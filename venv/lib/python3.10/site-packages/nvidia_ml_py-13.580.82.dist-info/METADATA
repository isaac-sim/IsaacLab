Python bindings to the NVIDIA Management Library
------------------------------------------------

Provides a Python interface to GPU management and monitoring functions.

This is a wrapper around the NVML library.
For information about the NVML library, see the NVML developer page
http://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-management-library-nvml

Download the latest package from:
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/nvidia-ml-py/

Note this file can be run with 'python -m doctest -v README.txt'
although the results are system dependent

The nvml header file contains function documentation that is relevant
to this wrapper. The header file is distributed with.
https://developer.nvidia.com/gpu-deployment-kit

The main difference is this library handles allocating structs and
passing pointers to the functions, before returning the desired value.
Non-success return codes are raised as exceptions as described in the
section below.

REQUIRES
--------
Python 2.5, or an earlier version with the ctypes module.

INSTALLATION
------------

Pip Installation with python3:
- `python3 -m pip install nvidia-ml-py`

Manual Installation:
```
$ tar -xzf nvidia-ml-py-$major-$minor-$patch.tar.gz`
$ cd nvidia-ml-py-$major-$minor-$patch
$ sudo python setup.py install
```

USAGE
-----
```
>>> from pynvml import *
>>> nvmlInit()
>>> print(f"Driver Version: {nvmlSystemGetDriverVersion()}")
Driver Version: 11.515.48
>>> deviceCount = nvmlDeviceGetCount()
>>> for i in range(deviceCount):
...     handle = nvmlDeviceGetHandleByIndex(i)
...     print(f"Device {i} : {nvmlDeviceGetName(handle)}")
...
Device 0 : Tesla K40c

>>> nvmlShutdown()
```

FUNCTIONS
---------
Python methods wrap NVML functions, implemented in a C shared library.
Each function's use is the same with the following exceptions:

- Instead of returning error codes, failing error codes are raised as Python exceptions.

```
>>> try:
...     nvmlDeviceGetCount()
... except NVMLError as error:
...     print(error)
...
Uninitialized
```

- C function output parameters are returned from the corresponding Python function left to right.
```
nvmlReturn_t nvmlDeviceGetEccMode(nvmlDevice_t device,
                                  nvmlEnableState_t *current,
                                  nvmlEnableState_t *pending);

>>> nvmlInit()
>>> handle = nvmlDeviceGetHandleByIndex(0)
>>> (current, pending) = nvmlDeviceGetEccMode(handle)
```
- C structs are converted into Python classes.

```
// C Function and typedef struct
nvmlReturn_t DECLDIR nvmlDeviceGetMemoryInfo(nvmlDevice_t device,
                                             nvmlMemory_t *memory);
typedef struct nvmlMemory_st {
    unsigned long long total;
    unsigned long long free;
    unsigned long long used;
} nvmlMemory_t;


# Python call to function and accessing members of ctype struct
>>> info = nvmlDeviceGetMemoryInfo(handle)
>>> print(f"Total memory: {info.total}")
Total memory: 5636292608
>>> print(f"Free memory:, {info.free}")
Free memory: 5578420224
>>> print(f"Used memory: {info.used}")
Used memory: 57872384
```

- Python handles string buffer creation.

```
// C Function that needs character array and length
nvmlReturn_t nvmlSystemGetDriverVersion(char* version,
                                        unsigned int length);

# Python function handles memory
>>> version = nvmlSystemGetDriverVersion()
>>> print(version)
... 11.520.75
>>> nvmlShutdown()
```

For usage information see the NVML documentation.

VARIABLES
---------
All meaningful NVML constants and enums are exposed in Python.

The NVML_VALUE_NOT_AVAILABLE constant is not used.  Instead None is mapped to the field.

EXCEPTIONS
----------
Since the C library uses return codes and python prefers exception handling, the
library converts all return codes to various exceptions. The exceptions are generated
automatically via a function at run time instead of being defined manually.

The list of exceptions can be found in NVMLError base class.

The example seen above in the FUNCTIONS section:

```
>>> try:
...     nvmlDeviceGetCount()
... except NVMLError as error:
...     print(error)
...
Uninitialized
```

Can be more accurately caught like this:

```
>>> try:
...     nvmlDeviceGetCount()
... except NVMLError_Uninitialized as error:
...     print(error)
...
Uninitialized
```

The conversion from name to exception is like this for all exceptions:
* `NVML_ERROR_UNINITIALIZED` => `NVMLError_Uninitialized`
* `NVML_ERROR_LIBRARY_NOT_FOUND` => `NVMLError_LibraryNotFound`
* `NVML_ERROR_ALREADY_INITIALIZED` => `NVMLError_AlreadyInitialized`
