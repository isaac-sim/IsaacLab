    """Create an ovstage stage using Isaac Lab's process-wide stage configuration.

    ovstage's hierarchy computation model drives its automatic world-transform updates. It is
    process-scoped rather than per-stage: ovstage applies it when the first process reference is
    acquired and raises if a later stage asks for a conflicting model while another stage is live.
    Every Isaac Lab stage is therefore created through this helper so the whole process agrees on
    one model. Builds that expose :class:`ovstage.StageConfig` request the CPU incremental model
    explicitly. Earlier compatible builds accept only the stage name and use that same model as
    their runtime default.

    :attr:`~ovstage.HierarchyComputationModel.GPU_INCREMENTAL` is currently not working - objects
    are out-of-place.  Needs investigation
