class BaseEnv:
    """The base environment encapsulates the simulation scene and the environment managers.

    While a simulation scene or world comprises of different components such as the robots, objects,
    and sensors (cameras, lidars, etc.), the environment is a higher level abstraction
    that provides an interface for interacting with the simulation. The environment is comprised of
    the following components:

    * **Scene**: The scene manager that creates and manages the virtual world in which the robot operates.
      This includes defining the robot, static and dynamic objects, sensors, etc.
    * **Observation Manager**: The observation manager that generates observations from the current simulation
      state and the data gathered from the sensors. These observations may include privileged information
      that is not available to the robot in the real world. Additionally, user-defined terms can be added
      to process the observations and generate custom observations. For example, using a network to embed
      high-dimensional observations into a lower-dimensional space.
    * **Action Manager**: The action manager that processes the raw actions sent to the environment and
      converts them to low-level commands that are sent to the simulation. It can be configured to accept
      raw actions at different levels of abstraction. For example, in case of a robotic arm, the raw actions
      can be joint torques, joint positions, or end-effector poses. Similarly for a mobile base, it can be
      the joint torques, or the desired velocity of the floating base.
    * **Command Generator**: The command generator that generates the goal commands for the robot. These
      commands are used by the observation manager to generate the observations. For example, in case of a
      robotic arm, the goal commands can be the object to be grasped, or the desired end-effector pose. For
      a mobile base, it can be the goal position and orientation of the base.

    The environment provides a unified interface for interacting with the simulation. However, it does not
    include task-specific quantities such as the reward function, or the termination conditions. These
    quantities are often specific to defining Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) while the base environment
    is agnostic to the MDP definition.

    The environment steps forward in time at a fixed time-step. The physics simulation is decimated at a
    lower time-step. This is to ensure that the simulation is stable. These two time-steps can be configured
    independently using the :attr:`BaseEnvCfg.decimation` (number of simulation steps per environment step)
    and the :attr:`BaseEnvCfg.sim.dt` (physics time-step) parameters. Based on these parameters, the
    environment time-step is computed as the product of the two. The two time-steps can be obtained by
    querying the :attr:`physics_dt` and the :attr:`step_dt` properties respectively.
