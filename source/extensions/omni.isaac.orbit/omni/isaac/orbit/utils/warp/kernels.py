    """Performs ray-casting against a mesh.

    This function performs ray-casting against the given mesh using the provided ray start positions
    and directions. The resulting ray hit positions are stored in the :obj:`ray_hits` array.

    Note that the `ray_starts`, `ray_directions`, and `ray_hits` arrays should have compatible shapes
    and data types to ensure proper execution. Additionally, they all must be in the same frame.

    The function utilizes the `mesh_query_ray` method from the `wp` module to perform the actual ray-casting
    operation. The maximum ray-cast distance is set to `1e6` units.

    Args:
        mesh: The input mesh. The ray-casting is performed against this mesh on the device specified by the
            `mesh`'s `device` attribute.
        ray_starts: The input ray start positions. Shape is (N, 3).
        ray_directions: The input ray directions. Shape is (N, 3).
        ray_hits: The output ray hit positions. Shape is (N, 3).
        ray_distance: The output ray hit distances. Shape is (N,), if `return_distance` is True. Otherwise,
            this array is not used.
        ray_normal: The output ray hit normals. Shape is (N, 3), if `return_normal` is True. Otherwise,
            this array is not used.
        ray_face_id: The output ray hit face ids. Shape is (N,), if `return_face_id` is True. Otherwise,
            this array is not used.
        max_dist: The maximum ray-cast distance. Defaults to 1e6.
        return_distance: Whether to return the ray hit distances. Defaults to False.
        return_normal: Whether to return the ray hit normals. Defaults to False`.
        return_face_id: Whether to return the ray hit face ids. Defaults to False.
