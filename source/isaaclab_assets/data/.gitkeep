For Isaac Lab, we primarily store assets on the Omniverse Nucleus server. However, at times, it may be
needed to store the assets locally (for debugging purposes). In such cases, this directory can be
used for temporary hosting of assets.

Inside the `data` directory, we recommend following the same structure as our Nucleus directory
`Isaac/IsaacLab`. Please check the extension's README for further details.
