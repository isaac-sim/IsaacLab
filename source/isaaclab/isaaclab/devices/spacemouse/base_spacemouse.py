    """A base class for SpaceMouse controllers.

    This class provides a common interface for SpaceMouse controllers.
    It abstracts away the details of connecting to and reading from the SpaceMouse device.
    It uses 'pyspacemouse'_ which is a Python library for 3Dconnexion SpaceMouse devices.
    The command comprises of two parts:
    * delta pose: a 6D vector of (x, y, z, roll, pitch, yaw) in meters and radians.
    * gripper: a binary command to open or close the gripper.

    Note:
        The interface finds and uses the first supported device connected to the computer.

    Currently tested for following devices:
    - SpaceMouse Wireless <https://3dconnexion.com/uk/product/spacemouse-wireless/>
    .. _pyspacemouse: https://pypi.org/project/pyspacemouse/
    Note that pyspacemouse library needs to be installed within IsaacSim python
    environment using the following command: `./python.sh -m pip install pyspacemouse`.
    Also, the instructions for setting up the device on Linux from the website above
    needs to be followed.
