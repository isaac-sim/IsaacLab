class TiledCamera(Camera):
    r"""The tiled rendering based camera sensor for acquiring the same data as the Camera class.

    This class inherits from the :class:`Camera` class but uses the tiled-rendering API to acquire
    the visual data. Tiled-rendering concatenates the rendered images from multiple cameras into a single image.
    This allows for rendering multiple cameras in parallel and is useful for rendering large scenes with multiple
    cameras efficiently.

    The following sensor types are supported:

    - ``"rgb"``: A 3-channel rendered color image.
    - ``"rgba"``: A 4-channel rendered color image with alpha channel.
    - ``"albedo"``: A 4-channel fast diffuse-albedo only path for color image.
      Note that this path will achieve the best performance when used alone or with depth only.
    - ``"distance_to_camera"``: An image containing the distance to camera optical center.
    - ``"distance_to_image_plane"``: An image containing distances of 3D points from camera plane along camera's z-axis.
    - ``"depth"``: Alias for ``"distance_to_image_plane"``.
    - ``"simple_shading_constant_diffuse"``: Simple shading (constant diffuse) RGB approximation.
    - ``"simple_shading_diffuse_mdl"``: Simple shading (diffuse MDL) RGB approximation.
    - ``"simple_shading_full_mdl"``: Simple shading (full MDL) RGB approximation.
    - ``"normals"``: An image containing the local surface normal vectors at each pixel.
    - ``"motion_vectors"``: An image containing the motion vector data at each pixel.
    - ``"semantic_segmentation"``: The semantic segmentation data.
    - ``"instance_segmentation_fast"``: The instance segmentation data.
    - ``"instance_id_segmentation_fast"``: The instance id segmentation data.

    .. note::
        Currently the following sensor types are not supported in a "view" format:

        - ``"instance_segmentation"``: The instance segmentation data. Please use the fast counterparts instead.
        - ``"instance_id_segmentation"``: The instance id segmentation data. Please use the fast counterparts instead.
        - ``"bounding_box_2d_tight"``: The tight 2D bounding box data (only contains non-occluded regions).
        - ``"bounding_box_2d_tight_fast"``: The tight 2D bounding box data (only contains non-occluded regions).
        - ``"bounding_box_2d_loose"``: The loose 2D bounding box data (contains occluded regions).
        - ``"bounding_box_2d_loose_fast"``: The loose 2D bounding box data (contains occluded regions).
        - ``"bounding_box_3d"``: The 3D view space bounding box data.
        - ``"bounding_box_3d_fast"``: The 3D view space bounding box data.

        were not available.
