"""
This module provides utility functions to determine the spawning order of environments
when multiple assets are used in a multi-USD (Universal Scene Description) simulation setup.

These functions define how environment indices (`env_idx`) are mapped to asset indices
when spawning environments in Isaac Sim or similar simulators.

Each function in this file should follow a standardized signature:
    (current_idx: int, total_prim_path: int, num_assets: int) -> int

Arguments:
- current_idx (int): The environment index (e.g., from 0 to n_tot - 1).
- total_prim_path (int): The total number of environments to spawn.
- num_assets (int): The number of different asset types available.

Use this module when you want to control how environments are distributed among multiple assets.
