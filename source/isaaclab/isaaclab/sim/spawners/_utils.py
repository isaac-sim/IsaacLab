def props_expr(prim_path: str, pattern: str) -> str:
    """Append a cfg-relative target pattern to an anchor prim path.

    Implements the key convention of the fragment mapping spawner configuration fields
    (e.g. :attr:`~isaaclab.sim.spawners.RigidObjectSpawnerCfg.rigid_props`): the key is a
    regular-expression suffix appended to the anchor prim path, so it carries its own leading
    ``/`` when it targets descendants. An empty key selects the anchor prim itself.

    The result is a plain regular expression matched against whole prim paths by
    :func:`~isaaclab.sim.utils.find_matching_prims`, so ``"/[^/]+"`` selects the anchor's direct
    children and ``"/.*"`` everything beneath it. Use ``"(/.*)?"`` on the rare occasion the anchor
    itself is also a valid family target.

    Args:
        prim_path: The absolute path of the anchor prim.
        pattern: The cfg-relative target pattern.

    Returns:
        The absolute prim path expression to pass to a fragment family writer.
