class PinkKinematicsConfiguration(Configuration):
    """
    A configuration class that maintains both a "controlled" (reduced) model and a "full" model.

    This class extends the standard Pink Configuration to allow for selective joint control:
    - The "controlled" model/data/q represent the subset of joints being actively controlled (e.g., a kinematic chain or arm).
    - The "full" model/data/q represent the complete robot, including all joints.

    This is useful for scenarios where only a subset of joints are being optimized or controlled, but full-model kinematics
    (e.g., for collision checking, full-body Jacobians, or visualization) are still required.

    The class ensures that both models are kept up to date, and provides methods to update both the controlled and full
    configurations as needed.
