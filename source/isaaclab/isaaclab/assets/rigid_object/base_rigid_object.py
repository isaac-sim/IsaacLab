class BaseRigidObject(AssetBase):
    """A rigid object asset class.

    Rigid objects are assets comprising of rigid bodies. They can be used to represent dynamic objects
    such as boxes, spheres, etc. A rigid body is described by its pose, velocity and mass distribution.

    For an asset to be considered a rigid object, the root prim of the asset must have the `USD RigidBodyAPI`_
    applied to it. This API is used to define the simulation properties of the rigid body. On playing the
    simulation, the physics engine will automatically register the rigid body and create a corresponding
    rigid body handle. This handle can be accessed using the :attr:`root_view` attribute.

    .. note::

        For users familiar with Isaac Sim, the PhysX view class API is not the exactly same as Isaac Sim view
        class API. Similar to Isaac Lab, Isaac Sim wraps around the PhysX view API. However, as of now (2023.1 release),
        we see a large difference in initializing the view classes in Isaac Sim. This is because the view classes
        in Isaac Sim perform additional USD-related operations which are slow and also not required.
