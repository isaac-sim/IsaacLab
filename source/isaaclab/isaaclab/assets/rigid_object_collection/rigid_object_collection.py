    """A rigid object collection class.

    This class represents a collection of rigid objects in the simulation, where the state of the rigid objects can be
    accessed and modified using a batched ``(env_ids, object_ids)`` API.

    For each rigid body in the collection, the root prim of the asset must have the `USD RigidBodyAPI`_
    applied to it. This API is used to define the simulation properties of the rigid bodies. On playing the
    simulation, the physics engine will automatically register the rigid bodies and create a corresponding
    rigid body handle. This handle can be accessed using the :attr:`root_physx_view` attribute.

    .. note::
        Rigid objects in the collection are uniquely identified via the key of the dictionary
        :attr:`~isaaclab.assets.RigidObjectCollectionCfg.rigid_objects` in :class:`~isaaclab.assets.RigidObjectCollectionCfg`.
        This differs from the class :class:`~isaaclab.assets.RigidObject`, where a rigid object is identified by
        the name of the Xform where the `USD RigidBodyAPI`_ is applied. This would not be possible for the rigid object
        collection since the :attr:`~isaaclab.assets.RigidObjectCollectionCfg.rigid_objects` dictionary could
        contain the same rigid object multiple times, leading to ambiguity.
