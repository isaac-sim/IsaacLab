    """A rigid object collection class.

    This class represents a collection of rigid objects in the simulation, where the state of the
    rigid objects can be accessed and modified using a batched ``(env_ids, object_ids)`` API.

    For each rigid body in the collection, the root prim of the asset must have the `USD RigidBodyAPI`_
    applied to it. This API is used to define the simulation properties of the rigid bodies. On playing the
    simulation, the physics engine will automatically register the rigid bodies and create a corresponding
    rigid body handle. This handle can be accessed using the :attr:`root_view` attribute.

    Rigid objects in the collection are uniquely identified via the key of the dictionary
    :attr:`~isaaclab.assets.RigidObjectCollectionCfg.rigid_objects` in the
    :class:`~isaaclab.assets.RigidObjectCollectionCfg` configuration class.
    This differs from the :class:`~isaaclab.assets.RigidObject` class, where a rigid object is identified by
    the name of the Xform where the `USD RigidBodyAPI`_ is applied. This would not be possible for the rigid
    object collection since the :attr:`~isaaclab.assets.RigidObjectCollectionCfg.rigid_objects` dictionary
    could contain the same rigid object multiple times, leading to ambiguity.
