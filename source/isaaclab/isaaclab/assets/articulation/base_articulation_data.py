    This class contains the data for an articulation in the simulation. The data includes the state of
    the root rigid body, the state of all the bodies in the articulation, and the joint state. The data is
    stored in the simulation world frame unless otherwise specified.

    An articulation is comprised of multiple rigid bodies or links. For a rigid body, there are two frames
    of reference that are used:

    - Actor frame: The frame of reference of the rigid body prim. This typically corresponds to the Xform prim
      with the rigid body schema.
    - Center of mass frame: The frame of reference of the center of mass of the rigid body.

    Depending on the settings, the two frames may not coincide with each other. In the robotics sense, the actor frame
    can be interpreted as the link frame.
