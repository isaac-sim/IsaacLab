class ObservationManager(ManagerBase):
    """Manager for computing observation signals for a given world.

    Observations are organized into groups based on their intended usage. This allows having different observation
    groups for different types of learning such as asymmetric actor-critic and student-teacher training. Each
    group contains observation terms which contain information about the observation function to call, the noise
    corruption model to use, and the sensor to retrieve data from.

    Each observation group should inherit from the :class:`ObservationGroupCfg` class. Within each group, each
    observation term should instantiate the :class:`ObservationTermCfg` class. Based on the configuration, the
    observations in a group can be concatenated into a single tensor or returned as a dictionary with keys
    corresponding to the term's name.

    If the observations in a group are concatenated, the shape of the concatenated tensor is computed based on the
    shapes of the individual observation terms. This information is stored in the :attr:`group_obs_dim` dictionary
    with keys as the group names and values as the shape of the observation tensor. When the terms in a group are not
    concatenated, the attribute stores a list of shapes for each term in the group.

    .. note::
        When the observation terms in a group do not have the same shape, the observation terms cannot be
        concatenated. In this case, please set the :attr:`ObservationGroupCfg.concatenate_terms` attribute in the
        group configuration to False.

    Observations can also have history. This means a running history is updated per sim step. History can be controlled
    per :class:`ObservationTermCfg` (See the :attr:`ObservationTermCfg.history_length` and
    :attr:`ObservationTermCfg.flatten_history_dim`). History can also be controlled via :class:`ObservationGroupCfg`
    where group configuration overwrites per term configuration if set. History follows an oldest to newest ordering.

    The observation manager can be used to compute observations for all the groups or for a specific group. The
    observations are computed by calling the registered functions for each term in the group. The functions are
    called in the order of the terms in the group. The functions are expected to return a tensor with shape
    (num_envs, ...).

    If a noise model or custom modifier is registered for a term, the function is called to corrupt
    the observation. The corruption function is expected to return a tensor with the same shape as the observation.
    The observations are clipped and scaled as per the configuration settings.
