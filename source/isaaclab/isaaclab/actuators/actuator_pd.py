    It uses the same model as the :class:`IdealActuator` for computing the torques from input commands.
    However, it implements a saturation model defined by DC motor characteristics.

    A DC motor is a type of electric motor that is powered by direct current electricity. In most cases,
    the motor is connected to a constant source of voltage supply, and the current is controlled by a rheostat.
    Depending on various design factors such as windings and materials, the motor can draw a limited maximum power
    from the electronic source, which limits the produced motor torque and speed.

    A DC motor characteristics are defined by the following parameters:

    * Continuous-rated speed (:math:`\dot{q}_{motor, max}`) : The maximum-rated speed of the motor.
    * Continuous-stall torque (:math:`\tau_{motor, max}`): The maximum-rated torque produced at 0 speed.
    * Saturation torque (:math:`\tau_{motor, sat}`): The maximum torque that can be outputted for a short period.

    Based on these parameters, the instantaneous minimum and maximum torques are defined as follows:

    .. math::

        \tau_{j, max}(\dot{q}) & = clip \left (\tau_{j, sat} \times \left(1 -
            \frac{\dot{q}}{\dot{q}_{j, max}}\right), 0.0, \tau_{j, max} \right) \\
        \tau_{j, min}(\dot{q}) & = clip \left (\tau_{j, sat} \times \left( -1 -
            \frac{\dot{q}}{\dot{q}_{j, max}}\right), - \tau_{j, max}, 0.0 \right)

    where :math:`\gamma` is the gear ratio of the gear box connecting the motor and the actuated joint ends,
    :math:`\dot{q}_{j, max} = \gamma^{-1} \times  \dot{q}_{motor, max}`, :math:`\tau_{j, max} =
    \gamma \times \tau_{motor, max}` and :math:`\tau_{j, peak} = \gamma \times \tau_{motor, peak}`
    are the maximum joint velocity, maximum joint torque and peak torque, respectively. These parameters
    are read from the configuration instance passed to the class.

    Using these values, the computed torques are clipped to the minimum and maximum values based on the
    instantaneous joint velocity:

        \tau_{j, applied} = clip(\tau_{computed}, \tau_{j, min}(\dot{q}), \tau_{j, max}(\dot{q}))
