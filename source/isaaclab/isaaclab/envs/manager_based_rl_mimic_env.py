class ManagerBasedRLMimicEnv(ManagerBasedRLEnv):
    """The superclass for the Isaac Lab Mimic environments.

    This class inherits from :class:`ManagerBasedRLEnv` and provides a template for the functions that
    need to be defined to run the Isaac Lab Mimic data generation workflow. The Isaac Lab data generation
    pipeline, inspired by the MimicGen system, enables the generation of new datasets based on a few human
    collected demonstrations. MimicGen is a novel approach designed to automatically synthesize large-scale,
    rich datasets from a sparse set of human demonstrations by adapting them to new contexts. It manages to
    replicate the benefits of large datasets while reducing the immense time and effort usually required to
    gather extensive human demonstrations.

    The MimicGen system works by parsing demonstrations into object-centric segments. It then adapts
    these segments to new scenes by transforming each segment according to the new sceneâ€™s context, stitching
    them into a coherent trajectory for a robotic end-effector to execute. This approach allows learners to train
    proficient agents through imitation learning on diverse configurations of scenes, object instances, etc.

    Key Features:
        - Efficient Dataset Generation: Utilizes a small set of human demos to produce large scale demonstrations.
        - Broad Applicability: Capable of supporting tasks that require a range of manipulation skills, such as
          pick-and-place and interacting with articulated objects.
        - Dataset Versatility: The synthetic data retains a quality that compares favorably with additional human demos.
