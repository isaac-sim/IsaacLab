# Acknowledgment

We would like to acknowledge [The AI Institute](https://theaiinstitute.com/)'s efforts in developing
the Spot RL environment from the specifications provided by Boston Dynamics.
The team at The AI Institute trained, verified, and deployed the resulting policy on the Spot hardware.
They demonstrated its capability and reliability out in the real world.

The accompanying deployment code and access to Spot's low-level API is available with the [Spot RL
Researcher Kit](https://bostondynamics.com/reinforcement-learning-researcher-kit/).
