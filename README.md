**Isaac Lab** is a unified and modular framework for robot learning that aims to simplify common workflows
in robotics research (such as RL, learning from demonstrations, and motion planning). It is built upon
[NVIDIA Isaac Sim](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/isaacsim/latest/overview.html) to leverage the latest
simulation capabilities for photo-realistic scenes and fast and accurate simulation.

Please refer to our [documentation page](https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab) to learn more about the
installation steps, features, tutorials, and how to set up your project with Isaac Lab.
