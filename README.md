**Isaac Lab** is a GPU-accelerated, open-source framework designed to unify and simplify robotics research workflows, such as reinforcement learning, imitation learning, and motion planning. Built on [NVIDIA Isaac Sim](https://docs.isaacsim.omniverse.nvidia.com/latest/index.html), it combines fast and accurate physics and sensor simulation, making it an ideal choice for sim-to-real transfer in robotics.

Isaac Lab provides developers with a range of essential features for accurate sensor simulation, such as RTX-based cameras, LIDAR, or contact sensors. The framework's GPU acceleration enables users to run complex simulations and computations faster, which is key for iterative processes like reinforcement learning and data-intensive tasks. Moreover, Isaac Lab can run locally or be distributed across the cloud, offering flexibility for large-scale deployments.

## Key Features

Isaac Lab offers a comprehensive set of tools and environments designed to facilitate robot learning:
- **Robots**: A diverse collection of robots, from manipulators, quadrupeds, to humanoids, with 16 commonly available models.
- **Environments**: Ready-to-train implementations of more than 30 environments, which can be trained with popular reinforcement learning frameworks such as RSL RL, SKRL, RL Games, or Stable Baselines. We also support multi-agent reinforcement learning.
- **Physics**: Rigid bodies, articulated systems, deformable objects
- **Sensors**: RGB/depth/segmentation cameras, camera annotations, IMU, contact sensors, ray casters.
