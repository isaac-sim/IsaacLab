**Isaac Lab** is a GPU-accelerated, open-source framework designed to unify and simplify robotics research workflows, such as reinforcement learning, imitation learning, and motion planning. Built on [NVIDIA Isaac Sim](https://docs.isaacsim.omniverse.nvidia.com/latest/index.html), it combines fast and accurate physics and sensor simulation, making it an ideal choice for sim-to-real transfer in robotics.

Isaac Lab provides developers with a range of essential features for accurate sensor simulation, such as RTX-based cameras, LIDAR, or contact sensors. The framework's GPU acceleration enables users to run complex simulations and computations faster, which is key for iterative processes like reinforcement learning and data-intensive tasks. Moreover, Isaac Lab can run locally or be distributed across the cloud, offering flexibility for large-scale deployments.


## Key Features

Isaac Lab offers a comprehensive set of tools and environments designed to facilitate robot learning:
- **Robots**: A diverse collection of robots, from manipulators, quadrupeds, to humanoids, with 16 commonly available models.
- **Environments**: Ready-to-train implementations of more than 30 environments, which can be trained with popular reinforcement learning frameworks such as RSL RL, SKRL, RL Games, or Stable Baselines. We also support multi-agent reinforcement learning.
- **Physics**: Rigid bodies, articulated systems, deformable objects
- **Sensors**: RGB/depth/segmentation cameras, camera annotations, IMU, contact sensors, ray casters.


## Getting Started

### Getting Started with Open-Source Isaac Sim

Isaac Sim is now open source and available on GitHub!

For detailed Isaac Sim installation instructions, please refer to
[Isaac Sim README](https://github.com/isaac-sim/IsaacSim?tab=readme-ov-file#quick-start).

1. Clone Isaac Sim

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/isaac-sim/IsaacSim.git
    ```

2. Build Isaac Sim

    ```
    cd IsaacSim
    ./build.sh
    ```

    On Windows, please use `build.bat` instead.

3. Clone Isaac Lab

    ```
    cd ..
    git clone https://github.com/isaac-sim/IsaacLab.git
    cd isaaclab
    ```

4. Set up symlink in Isaac Lab

    Linux:

    ```
    ln -s ../IsaacSim/_build/linux-x86_64/release _isaac_sim
    ```

    Windows:

    ```
    mklink /D _isaac_sim ..\IsaacSim\_build\windows-x86_64\release
    ```

5. Install Isaac Lab

    Linux:

    ```
    ./isaaclab.sh -i
    ```

    Windows:

    ```
    isaaclab.bat -i
    ```

6. [Optional] Set up a virtual python environment (e.g. for Conda)

    Linux:

    ```
    source _isaac_sim/setup_conda_env.sh
    ```

    Windows:

    ```
    _isaac_sim\setup_python_env.bat
    ```

7. Train!

    Linux:

    ```
    ./isaaclab.sh -p scripts/reinforcement_learning/skrl/train.py --task Isaac-Ant-v0 --headless
    ```

    Windows:

    ```
    isaaclab.bat -p scripts\reinforcement_learning\skrl\train.py --task Isaac-Ant-v0 --headless
    ```
