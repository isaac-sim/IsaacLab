Designing an Environment
========================

The following tutorials introduce the concept of manager-based environments: :class:`~isaaclab.envs.ManagerBasedEnv`
and its derivative :class:`~isaaclab.envs.ManagerBasedRLEnv`, as well as the direct workflow base class
:class:`~isaaclab.envs.DirectRLEnv`. These environments bring-in together
different aspects of the framework to create a simulation environment for agent interaction.
