Reinforcement Learning Library Comparison
=========================================

In this section, we provide an overview of the supported reinforcement learning libraries in Isaac Lab,
along with performance benchmarks across the libraries.

The supported libraries are:

- `SKRL <https://skrl.readthedocs.io>`__
- `RSL-RL <https://github.com/leggedrobotics/rsl_rl>`__
- `RL-Games <https://github.com/Denys88/rl_games>`__
- `Stable-Baselines3 <https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/index.html>`__

Training Performance
--------------------

We performed training with each RL library on the same ``Isaac-Humanoid-v0`` environment
with ``--headless`` on a single RTX 4090 GPU
and logged the total training time for 65.5M steps for each RL library.
