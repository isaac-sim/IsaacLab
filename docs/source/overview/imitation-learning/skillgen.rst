SkillGen for Automated Demonstration Generation
===============================================

SkillGen is an advanced demonstration generation system that enhances Isaac Lab Mimic by integrating motion planning. It generates high-quality, adaptive, collision-free robot demonstrations by combining human-provided subtask segments with automated motion planning.

What is SkillGen?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SkillGen addresses key limitations in traditional demonstration generation:

* **Motion Quality**: Uses cuRobo's GPU-accelerated motion planner to generate smooth, collision-free trajectories
* **Validity**: Generates kinematically feasible plans between skill segments
* **Diversity**: Generates varied demonstrations through configurable sampling and planning parameters
* **Adaptability**: Generates demonstrations that can be adapted to new object placements and scene configurations during data generation

The system works by taking manually annotated human demonstrations, extracting localized subtask skills (see `Subtasks in SkillGen`_), and using cuRobo to plan feasible motions between these skill segments while respecting robot kinematics and collision constraints.

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before using SkillGen, you must understand:

1. **Teleoperation**: How to control robots and record demonstrations using keyboard, SpaceMouse, or hand tracking
2. **Isaac Lab Mimic**: The complete workflow including data collection, annotation, generation, and policy training

.. important::

   Review the :ref:`teleoperation-imitation-learning` documentation thoroughly before proceeding with SkillGen.

.. _skillgen-installation:

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

SkillGen requires Isaac Lab, Isaac Sim, and cuRobo. Follow these steps in your Isaac Lab conda environment.

Step 1: Install and verify Isaac Sim and Isaac Lab
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Follow the official Isaac Sim and Isaac Lab installation guide `here <https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/main/source/setup/installation/pip_installation.html#installing-isaac-lab>`__.

Step 2: Install cuRobo
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

cuRobo provides the motion planning capabilities for SkillGen. This installation is tested to work with Isaac Lab's PyTorch and CUDA requirements:

.. code:: bash

   # One line installation of cuRobo (formatted for readability)
   conda install -c nvidia cuda-toolkit=12.8 -y && \
   export CUDA_HOME="$CONDA_PREFIX" && \
   export PATH="$CUDA_HOME/bin:$PATH" && \
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$CUDA_HOME/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH" && \
   export TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST="8.0+PTX" && \
   pip install -e "git+https://github.com/NVlabs/curobo.git@ebb71702f3f70e767f40fd8e050674af0288abe8#egg=nvidia-curobo" --no-build-isolation

.. note::
   * The commit hash ``ebb71702f3f70e767f40fd8e050674af0288abe8`` is tested with Isaac Lab - using other versions may cause compatibility issues. This commit has the support for quad face mesh triangulation, required for cuRobo to parse usds as collision objects.

   * cuRobo is installed from source and is editable installed. This means that the cuRobo source code will be cloned in the current directory under ``src/nvidia-curobo``. Users can choose their working directory to install cuRobo.

Step 3: Install Rerun
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For trajectory visualization during development:

.. code:: bash

   pip install rerun-sdk==0.23

.. note::

   **Rerun Visualization Setup:**

   * Rerun is optional but highly recommended for debugging and validating planned trajectories during development
   * Enable trajectory visualization by setting ``visualize_plan = True`` in the cuRobo planner configuration
   * When enabled, cuRobo planner interface will stream planned end-effector trajectories, waypoints, and collision data to Rerun for interactive inspection
   * Visualization helps identify planning issues, collision problems, and trajectory smoothness before full dataset generation
   * Can also be ran with ``--headless`` to disable isaacsim visualization but still visualize and debug end effector trajectories

Step 4: Verify Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Test that cuRobo works with Isaac Lab:

.. code:: bash

   # This should run without import errors
   python -c "import curobo; print('cuRobo installed successfully')"

.. tip::

   If you run into ``libstdc++.so.6: version 'GLIBCXX_3.4.30' not found`` error, you can try these commands to fix it:

   .. code:: bash

      conda config --env --set channel_priority strict
      conda config --env --add channels conda-forge
      conda install -y -c conda-forge "libstdcxx-ng>=12" "libgcc-ng>=12"

Download the SkillGen Dataset
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We provide a pre-annotated dataset to help you get started quickly with SkillGen.

Dataset Contents
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The dataset contains:

* Human demonstrations of Franka arm cube stacking
* Manually annotated subtask boundaries for each demonstration
* Compatible with both basic cube stacking and adaptive bin stacking tasks

Download and Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Download the pre-annotated dataset by clicking `here <https://omniverse-content-production.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Assets/Isaac/5.0/Isaac/IsaacLab/Mimic/franka_stack_datasets/annotated_dataset_skillgen.hdf5>`__.

2. Prepare the datasets directory and move the downloaded file:

.. code:: bash

   # Make sure you are in the root directory of your Isaac Lab workspace
   cd /path/to/your/IsaacLab

   # Create the datasets directory if it does not exist
   mkdir -p datasets

   # Move the downloaded dataset into the datasets directory
   mv /path/to/annotated_dataset_skillgen.hdf5 datasets/annotated_dataset_skillgen.hdf5

.. tip::

   A major advantage of SkillGen is that the same annotated dataset can be reused across multiple related tasks (e.g., basic stacking and adaptive bin stacking). This avoids collecting and annotating new data per variant.

.. admonition:: {Optional for the tasks in this tutorial} Collect a fresh dataset (source + annotated)

      If you want to collect a fresh source dataset and then create an annotated dataset for SkillGen, follow these commands. The user is expected to have knowledge of the Isaac Lab Mimic workflow.

   **Important pointers before you begin**

   * Using the provided annotated dataset is the fastest path to get started with SkillGen tasks in this tutorial.
   * If you create your own dataset, SkillGen requires manual annotation of both subtask start and termination boundaries (no auto-annotation).
   * Start boundary signals are mandatory for SkillGen; use ``--annotate_subtask_start_signals`` during annotation or data generation will fail.
   * Keep your subtask definitions (``object_ref``, ``subtask_term_signal``) consistent with the SkillGen environment config.

   **Record demonstrations** (any teleop device is supported; replace ``spacemouse`` if needed):

   .. code:: bash

      ./isaaclab.sh -p scripts/tools/record_demos.py \
      --task Isaac-Stack-Cube-Franka-IK-Rel-Skillgen-v0 \
      --teleop_device spacemouse \
      --dataset_file ./datasets/dataset_skillgen.hdf5 \
      --num_demos 10

   **Annotate demonstrations for SkillGen** (writes both term and start boundaries):

   .. code:: bash

      ./isaaclab.sh -p scripts/imitation_learning/isaaclab_mimic/annotate_demos.py \
      --device cpu \
      --task Isaac-Stack-Cube-Franka-IK-Rel-Skillgen-v0 \
      --input_file ./datasets/dataset_skillgen.hdf5 \
      --output_file ./datasets/annotated_dataset_skillgen.hdf5 \
      --annotate_subtask_start_signals

Understanding Dataset Annotation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SkillGen requires datasets with annotated subtask start and termination boundaries. Auto-annotation is not supported.

Subtasks in SkillGen
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Technical definition:** A subtask is a contiguous demo segment that achieves a manipulation objective, defined via ``SubTaskConfig``:

* ``object_ref``: the object (or ``None``) used as the spatial reference for this subtask
* ``subtask_term_signal``: the binary termination signal name (transitions 0 to 1 when the subtask completes)
* ``subtask_start_signal``: the binary start signal name (transitions 0 to 1 when the subtask begins; required for SkillGen)

The subtask localization process performs:

* detection of signal transition points (0 to 1) to identify subtask boundaries ``[t_start, t_end]``;
* extraction of the subtask segment between boundaries;
* computation of end-effector trajectories and key poses in an object- or task-relative frame (using ``object_ref`` if provided);

This converts absolute, scene-specific motions into object-relative skill segments that can be adapted to new object placements and scene configurations during data generation.

Manual Annotation Workflow
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Contrary to the Isaac Lab Mimic workflow, SkillGen requires manual annotation of subtask start and termination boundaries. For example, for grasping a cube, the start signal is right before the gripper closes and the termination signal is right after the object is grasped. You can adjust the start and termination signals to fit your subtask definition.

.. tip::

   **Manual Annotation Controls:**

   * Press ``N`` to start/continue playback
   * Press ``B`` to pause
   * Press ``S`` to mark subtask boundary
   * Press ``Q`` to skip current demonstration

   When annotating the start and end signals for a skill segment (e.g., grasp, stack, etc.), pause the playback using ``B`` a few steps before the skill, annotate the start signal using ``S``, and then resume playback using ``N``. After the skill is completed, pause again a few steps later to annotate the end signal using ``S``.

Data Generation with SkillGen
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SkillGen transforms annotated demonstrations into diverse, high-quality datasets using motion planning.

How SkillGen Works
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The SkillGen pipeline uses your annotated dataset and the environment's Mimic API to synthesize new demonstrations:

1. **Subtask boundary use**: Reads per-subtask start and termination indices from the annotated dataset
2. **Goal sampling**: Samples target poses per subtask according to task constraints and datagen config
3. **Trajectory planning**: Plans collision-free motions between subtask segments using cuRobo (when ``--use_skillgen``)
4. **Trajectory stitching**: Stitches skill segments and planned trajectories into complete demonstrations.
5. **Success evaluation**: Validates task success terms; only successful trials are written to the output dataset

Usage Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Key parameters for SkillGen data generation:

* ``--use_skillgen``: Enables SkillGen planner (required)
* ``--generation_num_trials``: Number of demonstrations to generate
* ``--num_envs``: Parallel environments (tune based on GPU memory)
* ``--device``: Computation device (cpu/cuda). Use cpu for stable physics
* ``--headless``: Disable visualization for faster generation

Task 1: Basic Cube Stacking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Generate demonstrations for the standard Isaac Lab Mimic cube stacking task. In this task, the Franka robot must:

1. Pick up the red cube and place it on the blue cube
2. Pick up the green cube and place it on the red cube
3. Final stack order: blue (bottom), red (middle), green (top).

   Cube stacking dataset example.

Small-Scale Generation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Start with a small dataset to verify everything works:

.. code:: bash

   ./isaaclab.sh -p scripts/imitation_learning/isaaclab_mimic/generate_dataset.py \
   --device cpu \
   --num_envs 1 \
   --generation_num_trials 10 \
   --input_file ./datasets/annotated_dataset_skillgen.hdf5 \
   --output_file ./datasets/generated_dataset_small_skillgen_cube_stack.hdf5 \
   --task Isaac-Stack-Cube-Franka-IK-Rel-Skillgen-v0 \
   --use_skillgen

Full-Scale Generation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once satisfied with small-scale results, generate a full training dataset:

.. code:: bash

   ./isaaclab.sh -p scripts/imitation_learning/isaaclab_mimic/generate_dataset.py \
   --device cpu \
   --headless \
   --num_envs 1 \
   --generation_num_trials 1000 \
   --input_file ./datasets/annotated_dataset_skillgen.hdf5 \
   --output_file ./datasets/generated_dataset_skillgen_cube_stack.hdf5 \
   --task Isaac-Stack-Cube-Franka-IK-Rel-Skillgen-v0 \
   --use_skillgen \
   --headless

.. note::

   * Use ``--headless`` to disable visualization for faster generation. Rerun visualization can be enabled by setting ``visualize_plan = True`` in the cuRobo planner configuration with ``--headless`` enabled as well for debugging.
   * Adjust ``--num_envs`` based on your GPU memory (start with 1, increase gradually). The performance gain is not very significant when num_envs is greater than 1. A value of 5 seems to be a sweet spot for most GPUs to balance performance and memory usage between cuRobo instances and simulation environments.
   * Generation time: ~90 to 120 minutes for one environment for 1000 demonstrations on modern GPUs. Time depends on the GPU, the number of environments, and the success rate of the demonstrations (which depends on quality of the annotated dataset).
   * cuRobo planner interface and configurations are described in :ref:`cuRobo-interface-features`.

Task 2: Adaptive Cube Stacking in a Bin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SkillGen can also be used to generate datasets for adaptive tasks. In this example, we generate a dataset for adaptive cube stacking in a narrow bin. The bin is placed at a fixed position and orientation in the workspace and a blue cube is placed at the center of the bin. The robot must generate successful demonstrations for stacking the red and green cubes on the blue cube without colliding with the bin.

   :figclass: align-center

   Adaptive bin stacking data generation example.

Small-Scale Generation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Test the adaptive stacking setup:

.. code:: bash

   ./isaaclab.sh -p scripts/imitation_learning/isaaclab_mimic/generate_dataset.py \
   --device cpu \
   --num_envs 1 \
   --generation_num_trials 10 \
   --input_file ./datasets/annotated_dataset_skillgen.hdf5 \
   --output_file ./datasets/generated_dataset_small_skillgen_bin_cube_stack.hdf5 \
   --task Isaac-Stack-Cube-Bin-Franka-IK-Rel-Mimic-v0 \
   --use_skillgen

Full-Scale Generation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Generate the complete adaptive stacking dataset:

.. code:: bash

   ./isaaclab.sh -p scripts/imitation_learning/isaaclab_mimic/generate_dataset.py \
   --device cpu \
   --headless \
   --num_envs 1 \
   --generation_num_trials 1000 \
   --input_file ./datasets/annotated_dataset_skillgen.hdf5 \
   --output_file ./datasets/generated_dataset_skillgen_bin_cube_stack.hdf5 \
   --task Isaac-Stack-Cube-Bin-Franka-IK-Rel-Mimic-v0 \
   --use_skillgen

.. warning::

   Adaptive tasks typically have lower success rates and higher data generation time due to increased complexity. The time taken to generate the dataset is also longer due to lower success rates than vanilla cube stacking and difficult planning problems.


Learning Policies from SkillGen Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Similar to the Isaac Lab Mimic workflow, you can train imitation learning policies using the generated SkillGen datasets with Robomimic.

Basic Cube Stacking Policy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Train a state-based policy for the basic cube stacking task:

.. code:: bash

   ./isaaclab.sh -p scripts/imitation_learning/robomimic/train.py \
   --task Isaac-Stack-Cube-Franka-IK-Rel-Skillgen-v0 \
   --algo bc \
   --dataset ./datasets/generated_dataset_skillgen_cube_stack.hdf5

Adaptive Bin Stacking Policy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Train a policy for the more complex adaptive bin stacking:

.. code:: bash

   ./isaaclab.sh -p scripts/imitation_learning/robomimic/train.py \
   --task Isaac-Stack-Cube-Bin-Franka-IK-Rel-Mimic-v0 \
   --algo bc \
   --dataset ./datasets/generated_dataset_skillgen_bin_cube_stack.hdf5

.. note::

   The training script will save the model checkpoints in the model directory under ``IssacLab/logs/robomimic``.

Evaluating Trained Policies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Test your trained policies:

.. code:: bash

   # Basic cube stacking evaluation
   ./isaaclab.sh -p scripts/imitation_learning/robomimic/play.py \
   --device cpu \
   --task Isaac-Stack-Cube-Franka-IK-Rel-Skillgen-v0 \
   --num_rollouts 50 \
   --checkpoint /path/to/model_checkpoint.pth

.. code:: bash

   # Adaptive bin stacking evaluation
   ./isaaclab.sh -p scripts/imitation_learning/robomimic/play.py \
   --device cpu \
   --task Isaac-Stack-Cube-Bin-Franka-IK-Rel-Mimic-v0 \
   --num_rollouts 50 \
   --checkpoint /path/to/model_checkpoint.pth

.. _cuRobo-interface-features:

cuRobo Interface Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section summarizes the cuRobo planner interface and features. The SkillGen pipeline uses the cuRobo planner to generate collision-free motions between subtask segments. However, the user can use cuRobo as a standalone motion planner for your own tasks. The user can also implement their own motion planner by subclassing the base motion planner and implementing the same API.

Base Motion Planner (Extensible)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Location: ``isaaclab_mimic/motion_planners/base_motion_planner.py``
* Purpose: Uniform interface for all motion planners used by SkillGen
* Extensibility: New planners can be added by subclassing and implementing the same API; SkillGen consumes the API without code changes

cuRobo Planner (GPU, collision-aware)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Location: ``isaaclab_mimic/motion_planners/curobo``
* Multi-phase planning:

  * Approach → Contact → Retreat phases per subtask
  * Configurable collision filtering in contact phases
  * For SkillGen, approach and retreat phases are collision-free. The transit phase is collision-checked.

* World synchronization:

  * Updates robot state, attached objects, and collision spheres from the Isaac Lab scene each trial
  * Dynamic attach/detach of objects during grasp/place

* Collision representation:

  * Contact-aware sphere sets with per-phase enables/filters

* Outputs:

  * Time-parameterized, collision-checked trajectories for stitching

* Tests:

  * ``source/isaaclab_mimic/test/test_curobo_planner_cube_stack.py``
  * ``source/isaaclab_mimic/test/test_curobo_planner_franka.py``
  * ``source/isaaclab_mimic/test/test_generate_dataset_skillgen.py``

.. note::

   For detailed cuRobo config creation and parameters, please see the file ``isaaclab_mimic/motion_planners/curobo/curobo_planner_config.py``.

Generation Pipeline Integration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When ``--use_skillgen`` is enabled in ``generate_dataset.py``, the following pipeline is executed:

1. **Randomize subtask boundaries**: Randomize per-demo start and termination indices for each subtask using task-configured offset ranges.

2. **Build per-subtask trajectories**:
   For each end-effector and subtask:

   - Select a source demonstration segment (strategy-driven; respects coordination/sequential constraints)
   - Transform the segment to the current scene (object-relative or coordination delta; optional first-pose interpolation)
   - Wrap the transformed segment into a waypoint trajectory

3. **Transition between subtasks**:
   - Plan a collision-aware transition with cuRobo to the subtask's first waypoint (world sync, optional attach/detach), execute the planned waypoints, then resume the subtask trajectory

4. **Execute with constraints**:
   - Execute waypoints step-by-step across end-effectors while enforcing subtask constraints (sequential, coordination with synchronous steps); optionally update planner visualization if enabled

5. **Record and export**:
   - Accumulate states/observations/actions, set the episode success flag, and export the episode (the outer pipeline filters/consumes successes)

Visualization and Debugging
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Users can visualize the planned trajectories and debug for collisions using Rerun-based plan visualizer. This can be enabled by setting ``visualize_plan = True`` in the cuRobo planner configuration. Note that rerun needs to be installed to visualize the planned trajectories. Refer to Step 3 in :ref:`skillgen-installation` for installation instructions.
