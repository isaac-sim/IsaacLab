Installation
============= 

Installing the Newton Physics Integration Branch requires three things:

1) Isaac sim 5.0 or greater
2) The experimental branch
3) Rebuilding Isaac Lab

To begin, verify the version of Isaac Sim by checking the title of the window created when launching the simulation app.  Alternatively, you can 
find more explicit version information under the ``Help -> About`` menu within the app. So long as that version is 5.0 or greater you will be able to  
use the experimental feature branch for Newton.  If your version is less than 5.0, you must first `update or reinstall Isaac Sim <https://docs.isaacsim.omniverse.nvidia.com/latest/installation/quick-install.html>`_ before 
you can proceed further.
