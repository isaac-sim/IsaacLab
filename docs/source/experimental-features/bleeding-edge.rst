Welcome to the bleeding edge!
=============================

Isaac Lab is open source because our intention is to grow a community of open collaboration for robotic simulation.
We believe that robust tools are crucial for the future of robotics.

Sometimes new features may require extensive changes to the internal structure of Isaac Lab.
Directly integrating such features before they are complete and without feedback from the full community could cause serious issues for users caught unaware.

To address this, some major features will be released as Experimental Feature Branches.
This way, the community can experiment with and contribute to the feature before it's fully integrated, reducing the likelihood of being derailed by unexpected and new errors.
