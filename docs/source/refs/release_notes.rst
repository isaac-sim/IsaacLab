v2.0.2
======

Overview
--------

This patch release focuses on improving actuator configuration and fixing key bugs while reverting unintended
behavioral changes from v2.0.1. **We strongly recommend switching** to this new version if you're migrating
from a pre-2.0 release of Isaac Lab.

**Key Changes:**

* **Actuator Limit Handling**: Introduced :attr:`~isaaclab.actuators.ActuatorBaseCfg.velocity_limit_sim`
  and :attr:`~isaaclab.actuators.ActuatorBaseCfg.effort_limit_sim` to clearly distinguish
  simulation solver limits from actuator model constraints. Reverted implicit actuator velocity limits
  to pre-v2.0 behavior
* **Simulation configuration update**: Removed :attr:`~isaaclab.sim.SimulationCfg.disable_contact_processing`
  flag to simplify behavior
* **Rendering configuration update**: Reverted to pre-2.0 configuration to improve the quality of the
  render product

Introduction of simulation's effort and velocity limits parameters in ActuatorBaseCfg
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have introduced the configuration variables :attr:`~isaaclab.actuators.ActuatorBaseCfg.velocity_limit_sim`
and :attr:`~isaaclab.actuators.ActuatorBaseCfg.effort_limit_sim` to the
:class:`isaaclab.actuators.ActuatorBaseCfg` to allow users to set the **simulation** joint velocity
and effort limits through the actuator configuration class.

Previously, we were overusing the attributes :attr:`~isaaclab.actuators.ActuatorBaseCfg.velocity_limit`
and :attr:`~isaaclab.actuators.ActuatorBaseCfg.effort_limit` inside the actuator configuration. A series
of changes in-between led to a regression from v1.4.0 to v2.0.1 release of IsaacLab. To make this
clearer to understand, we note the change in their behavior in a tabular form:

+---------------+-------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
| Actuator Type | Attribute               | v1.4.0 Behavior                                                    | v2.0.1 Behavior                                                |
+---------------+-------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
| Implicit      | :attr:`velocity_limit`  | Ignored, not set into simulation                                   | Set into simulation                                            |
| Implicit      | :attr:`effort_limit`    | Set into simulation                                                | Set into simulation                                            |
| Explicit      | :attr:`velocity_limit`  | Used by actuator models (e.g., DC Motor), not set into simulation  | Used by actuator models (e.g., DC Motor), set into simulation  |
| Explicit      | :attr:`effort_limit`    | Used by actuator models, not set into simulation                   | Used by actuator models, set into simulation                   |
+---------------+-------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+

Setting the limits from the configuration into the simulation directly affects the behavior
of the underlying physics engine solver. This impact is particularly noticeable when velocity
limits are too restrictive, especially in joints with high stiffness, where it becomes easier
to reach these limits. As a result, the change in behavior caused previously trained policies
to not function correctly in IsaacLab v2.0.1.

Consequently, we have reverted back to the prior behavior and added :attr:`velocity_limit_sim` and
:attr:`effort_limit_sim` attributes to make it clear that setting those parameters means
changing solver's configuration. The new behavior is as follows:

+----------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| Attribute                  | Implicit Actuator                                      | Explicit Actuator                                           |
+============================+========================================================+=============================================================+
| :attr:`velocity_limit`     | Ignored, not set into simulation                       | Used by the model (e.g., DC Motor), not set into simulation |
| :attr:`effort_limit`       | Set into simulation (same as :attr:`effort_limit_sim`) | Used by the models, not set into simulation                 |
| :attr:`velocity_limit_sim` | Set into simulation                                    | Set into simulation                                         |
| :attr:`effort_limit_sim`   | Set into simulation (same as :attr:`effort_limit`)     | Set into simulation                                         |
+----------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+

Users are advised to use the ``xxx_sim`` flag if they want to directly modify the solver limits.

Removal of ``disable_contact_processing`` flag in ``SimulationCfg``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have now removed the ``disable_contact_processing`` flag from the :class:`isaaclab.sim.SimulationCfg`
to not have the user worry about these intricacies of the simulator. The flag is always True by
default unless a contact sensor is created (which will internally set this flag to False).

Previously, the flag ``disable_contact_processing`` led to confusion about its
behavior. As the name suggests, the flag controls the contact reporting from the
underlying physics engine, PhysX. Disabling this flag (note the double negation)
means that PhysX collects the contact information from its solver and allows
reporting them to the user. Enabling this flag means this operation is not performed and
the overhead of it is avoided.

Many of our examples (for instance, the locomotion environments) were setting this
flag to True which meant the contacts should **not** get reported. However, this issue
was not noticed earlier since GPU simulation bypasses this flag, and only CPU simulation
gets affected. Running the same examples on CPU device led to different behaviors
because of this reason.

Existing users, who currently set this flag themselves, should receive a deprecated
warning mentioning the removal of this flag and the switch to the new default behavior.

Switch to older rendering settings to improve render quality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With the IsaacLab 2.0.0 release, we switched to new render settings aimed at improving
tiled-rendering performance, but at the cost of reduced rendering quality. This change
particularly affected dome lighting in the scene, which is the default in many of our examples.

As reported by several users, this change negatively impacted render quality, even in
cases where it wasnâ€™t necessary (such as when recording videos of the simulation). In
response to this feedback, we have reverted to the previous render settings by default
to restore the quality users expected.

For users looking to trade render quality for speed, we will provide guidelines in the future.


v2.0.1
======

Overview
--------

This release contains a small set of fixes and improvements.

The main change was to maintain combability with the updated library name for RSL RL, which breaks the previous installation methods for Isaac Lab. This release provides the necessary fixes and updates in Isaac Lab to accommodate for the name change and maintain combability with installation for RSL RL.

v2.0.0
======

Overview
--------

Isaac Lab 2.0 brings some exciting new features, including a new addition to the Imitation Learning workflow with
the **Isaac Lab Mimic** extension.

Isaac Lab Mimic provides the ability to automatically generate additional trajectories based on just a few human
collected demonstrations, allowing for larger training datasets with less human effort. This work is based on the
`MimicGen <https://mimicgen.github.io/>`_ work for Scalable Robot Learning using Human Demonstrations.

Additionally, we introduced a new set of AMP tasks based on
`Adversarial Motion Priors <https://xbpeng.github.io/projects/AMP/index.html>`_, training humanoid robots to walk, run,
and dance.

Along with Isaac Lab 2.0, Isaac Sim 4.5 brings several new and breaking changes, including a full refactor of the
Isaac Sim extensions, an improved URDF importer, an update to the PyTorch dependency to version 2.5.1, and many
fixes for tiled rendering that now supports multiple tiled cameras at different resolutions.

To follow the refactoring in Isaac Sim, we made similar refactoring and restructuring changes to Isaac Lab.
These breaking changes will no longer be compatible with previous Isaac Sim versions.

.. attention::

    Please make sure to update to Isaac Sim 4.5 when using the Isaac Lab 2.0 release.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/isaac-sim/IsaacLab/compare/v1.4.1...v2.0.0

.. attention::

	We have identified a breaking feature for semantic segmentation and instance segmentation when using
	``TiledCamera`` with instanceable assets. Since the Isaac Sim 4.5 / Isaac Lab 2.0 release, semantic and instance
	segmentation outputs only render the first tile correctly and produces blank outputs for the remaining tiles.
	We will be introducing a workaround for this fix to remove scene instancing if semantic segmentation or instance
	segmentation is required for ``TiledCamera`` until we receive a proper fix from Omniverse as part of the next Isaac Sim release.

Migration Guide
---------------

Renaming of Isaac Sim Extensions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Previously, Isaac Sim extensions have been following the convention of ``omni.isaac.*``,
such as ``omni.isaac.core``. In Isaac Sim 4.5, Isaac Sim extensions have been renamed
to use the prefix ``isaacsim``, replacing ``omni.isaac``. In addition, many extensions
have been renamed and split into multiple extensions to prepare for a more modular
framework that can be customized by users through the use of app templates.

Notably, the following commonly used Isaac Sim extensions in Isaac Lab are renamed as follow:

* ``omni.isaac.cloner`` --> :mod:`isaacsim.core.cloner`
* ``omni.isaac.core.prims`` --> :mod:`isaacsim.core.prims`
* ``omni.isaac.core.simulation_context`` --> :mod:`isaacsim.core.api.simulation_context`
* ``omni.isaac.core.utils`` --> :mod:`isaacsim.core.utils`
* ``omni.isaac.core.world`` --> :mod:`isaacsim.core.api.world`
* ``omni.isaac.kit.SimulationApp`` --> :mod:`isaacsim.SimulationApp`
* ``omni.isaac.ui`` --> :mod:`isaacsim.gui.components`

Renaming of the URDF and MJCF Importers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting from Isaac Sim 4.5, the URDF and MJCF importers have been renamed to be more consistent
with the other extensions in Isaac Sim. The importers are available on isaac-sim GitHub
as open source projects.

Due to the extension name change, the Python module names have also been changed:

* URDF Importer: :mod:`isaacsim.asset.importer.urdf` (previously :mod:`omni.importer.urdf`)
* MJCF Importer: :mod:`isaacsim.asset.importer.mjcf` (previously :mod:`omni.importer.mjcf`)

From the Isaac Sim UI, both URDF and MJCF importers can now be accessed directly from the File > Import
menu when selecting a corresponding .urdf or .xml file in the file browser.

Changes in URDF Importer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Isaac Sim 4.5 brings some updates to the URDF Importer, with a fresh UI to allow for better configurations
when importing robots from URDF. As a result, the Isaac Lab URDF Converter has also been updated to
reflect these changes. The :class:`isaaclab.sim.converters.UrdfConverterCfg` includes some new settings,
such as :class:`~isaaclab.sim.converters.JointDriveCfg.PDGainsCfg`
and :class:`~isaaclab.sim.converters.JointDriveCfg.NaturalFrequencyGainsCfg` classes for configuring
the gains of the drives.

One breaking change to note is that the :attr:`~isaaclab.sim.converters.UrdfConverterCfg.JointDriveCfg.gains`
attribute must be of class type :class:`~isaaclab.sim.converters.JointDriveCfg.PDGainsCfg` or
:class:`~isaaclab.sim.converters.JointDriveCfg.NaturalFrequencyGainsCfg`.

The stiffness of the :class:`~isaaclab.sim.converters.JointDriveCfg.PDGainsCfg` must be specified, as such:

.. code-block:: python

    joint_drive=sim_utils.UrdfConverterCfg.JointDriveCfg(
        gains=sim_utils.UrdfConverterCfg.JointDriveCfg.PDGainsCfg(stiffness=None, damping=None)
    )


The :attr:`~isaaclab.sim.converters.JointDriveCfg.NaturalFrequencyGainsCfg.natural_frequency` attribute must
be specified for :class:`~isaaclab.sim.converters.JointDriveCfg.NaturalFrequencyGainsCfg`.


Renaming of Isaac Lab Extensions and Folders
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Corresponding to Isaac Sim 4.5 changes, we have also made some updates to the Isaac Lab directories and extensions.
All extensions that were previously under ``source/extensions`` are now under the ``source/`` directory directly.
The ``source/apps`` and ``source/standalone`` folders have been moved to the root directory and are now called
``apps/`` and ``scripts/``.

Isaac Lab extensions have been renamed to:

* ``omni.isaac.lab`` --> :mod:`isaaclab`
* ``omni.isaac.lab_assets`` --> :mod:`isaaclab_assets`
* ``omni.isaac.lab_tasks`` --> :mod:`isaaclab_tasks`

In addition, we have split up the previous ``source/standalone/workflows`` directory into ``scripts/imitation_learning``
and ``scripts/reinforcement_learning`` directories. The RSL RL, Stable-Baselines, RL_Games, SKRL, and Ray directories
are under ``scripts/reinforcement_learning``, while Robomimic and the new Isaac Lab Mimic directories are under
``scripts/imitation_learning``.

To assist with the renaming of Isaac Lab extensions in your project, we have provided a
`simple script <https://gist.github.com/kellyguo11/3e8f73f739b1c013b1069ad372277a85>`_ that will traverse
through the ``source`` and ``docs`` directories in your local Isaac Lab project and replace any instance of the renamed
directories and imports. **Please use the script at your own risk as it will overwrite source files directly.**


Restructuring of Isaac Lab Extensions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With the introduction of :mod:`isaaclab_mimic`, designed for supporting data generation workflows for imitation learning,
we have also split out the previous ``wrappers`` folder under ``isaaclab_tasks`` to its own module, named :mod:`isaaclab_rl`.
This new extension will contain reinforcement learning specific wrappers for the various RL libraries supported by Isaac Lab.

The new :mod:`isaaclab_mimic` extension will also replace the previous imitation learning scripts under the ``robomimic`` folder.
We have removed the old scripts for data collection and dataset preparation in favor of the new mimic workflow. For users
who prefer to use the previous scripts, they will be available in previous release branches.

Additionally, we have also restructured the :mod:`isaaclab_assets` extension to be split into ``robots`` and ``sensors``
subdirectories. This allows for clearer separation between the pre-defined configurations provided in the extension.

As an example, the following import:

.. code-block:: python

    from omni.isaac.lab_assets.anymal import ANYMAL_C_CFG

should be replaced with:

.. code-block:: python

    from isaaclab_assets.robots.anymal import ANYMAL_C_CFG


v1.4.1
======

Overview
--------

This release contains a set of improvements and bug fixes.

Most importantly, we reverted one of the `changes from the previous release <https://github.com/isaac-sim/IsaacLab/pull/966>`_
to ensure the training throughput performance remains the same.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/isaac-sim/IsaacLab/compare/v1.4.0...v1.4.1

This is the **final release compatible with Isaac Sim 4.2**. The next release will target Isaac Sim 4.5,
which introduces breaking changes that will make Isaac Lab incompatible with earlier versions of Isaac Sim.

This release will be a final release based on Isaac Sim 4.2 before the transition to Isaac Sim 4.5, which will
likely contain breaking changes and no longer backwards compatible with Isaac Sim 4.2 and earlier. In this release,
we introduce many features, improvements, and bug fixes, including IMU sensors, support for various types of
gymnasium spaces, manager-based perception environments, and more.

* Drops support for ``TiledCamera`` for Isaac Sim 4.1

Migration Guide
---------------

Setting the simulation device into the simulation context
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Previously, changing the simulation device to CPU required users to set other simulation parameters (such as disabling GPU physics and GPU pipelines). This made setting up the device appear complex. We now simplify the checks for device directly inside the simulation context, so users only need to specify the device through the configuration object.

Before:

.. code:: python

    sim_utils.SimulationCfg(device="cpu", use_gpu_pipeline=False, dt=0.01, physx=sim_utils.PhysxCfg(use_gpu=False))

Now:

.. code:: python

    sim_utils.SimulationCfg(device="cpu", dt=0.01, physx=sim_utils.PhysxCfg())

Setting the simulation device from CLI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Previously, users could specify the device through the command line argument ``--device_id``. However, this made it ambiguous when users wanted to set the device to CPU. Thus, instead of the device ID, users need to specify the device explicitly through the argument ``--device``. The valid options for the device name are:

* "cpu": runs simulation on CPU
* "cuda": runs simulation on GPU with device ID at default index
* "cuda:N": runs simulation on GPU with device ID at ``N``. For instance, "cuda:0" will use device at index "0".

Due to the above change, the command line interaction with some of the scripts has changed.

Before:

.. code:: bash

    ./isaaclab.sh -p source/standalone/workflows/sb3/train.py --task Isaac-Cartpole-v0 --headless --cpu

Now:

.. code:: bash

    ./isaaclab.sh -p source/standalone/workflows/sb3/train.py --task Isaac-Cartpole-v0 --headless --device cpu

Renaming of teleoperation device CLI in standalone scripts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since ``--device`` is now an argument provided by the AppLauncher, it conflicted with the command-line argument used for specifying the teleoperation-device in some of the standalone scripts. Thus, to fix this conflict, the teleoperation-device now needs to be specified through ``--teleop_device`` argument.

Before:

.. code:: bash

    ./isaaclab.sh -p source/standalone/environments/teleoperation/teleop_se3_agent.py --task Isaac-Lift-Cube-Franka-IK-Rel-v0 --num_envs 1 --device keyboard

Now:

.. code:: bash

    ./isaaclab.sh -p source/standalone/environments/teleoperation/teleop_se3_agent.py --task Isaac-Lift-Cube-Franka-IK-Rel-v0 --num_envs 1 --teleop_device keyboard


Using Python-version of container utility script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The prior `container.sh <https://github.com/isaac-sim/IsaacLab/blob/v1.1.0/docker/container.sh>`_ became quite complex as it had many different use cases in one script. For instance, building a docker image for "base" or "ros2", as well as cluster deployment. As more users wanted to have the flexibility to overlay their own docker settings, maintaining this bash script became cumbersome. Hence, we migrated its features into a Python script in this release. Additionally, we split the cluster-related utilities into their own script inside the ``docker/cluster`` directory.

We still maintain backward compatibility for ``container.sh``. Internally, it calls the Python script ``container.py``. We request users to use the Python script directly.

Before:

.. code:: bash

    ./docker/container.sh start


Now:

.. code:: bash

    ./docker/container.py start


Using separate directories for logging videos in RL workflows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Previously, users could record videos during the RL training by specifying the ``--video`` flag to the ``train.py`` script. The videos would be saved inside the ``videos`` directory in the corresponding log directory of the run.

Since many users requested to also be able to record videos while inferencing the policy, recording videos have also been added to the ``play.py`` script. Since changing the prefix of the video file names is not possible, the videos from the train and play scripts are saved inside the ``videos/train`` and ``videos/play`` directories, respectively.

Drops support for the tiled camera with Isaac Sim 4.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Various fixes have been made to the tiled camera rendering pipeline in Isaac Sim 4.2. This made supporting the tiled camera with Isaac Sim 4.1 difficult. Hence, for the best experience, we advice switching to Isaac Sim 4.2 with this release of Isaac Lab.

Migration Guide
---------------

Renaming of ``SimulationCfg.substeps``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Previously, the users set both ``omni.isaac.lab.sim.SimulationCfg.dt`` and ``omni.isaac.lab.sim.SimulationCfg.substeps``, which marked the physics insulation time-step and sub-steps, respectively. It was unclear whether sub-steps meant the number of integration steps inside the physics time-step ``dt`` or the number of physics steps inside a rendering step.

Since in the code base, the attribute was used as the latter, it has been renamed to ``render_interval`` for clarity.

Removal of Deprecated Attributes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As notified in previous releases, we removed the classes and attributes marked as deprecated. These are as follows:

* The ``mdp.add_body_mass`` method in the events. Please use the ``mdp.randomize_rigid_body_mass`` instead.
* The classes ``managers.RandomizationManager`` and ``managers.RandomizationTermCfg``. Please use the
  ``managers.EventManager`` and ``managers.EventTermCfg`` classes instead.
* The following properties in ``omni.isaac.lab.sensors.FrameTransformerData``:
  * ``target_rot_source`` --> ``target_quat_w``
  * ``target_rot_w`` --> ``target_quat_source``
  * ``source_rot_w`` --> ``source_quat_w``

* The attribute ``body_physx_view`` from the ``omni.isaac.lab.assets.Articulation`` and
  ``omni.isaac.lab.assets.RigidObject`` classes. These caused confusion when used with the articulation view
  since the body names did not follow the same ordering.

v1.0.0
======

Overview
--------

Welcome to the first official release of Isaac Lab!

Building upon the foundation of the `Orbit <https://isaac-orbit.github.io/>`_ framework, we have integrated
the RL environment designing workflow from `OmniIsaacGymEnvs <https://github.com/NVIDIA-Omniverse/OmniIsaacGymEnvs>`_.
This allows users to choose a suitable `task-design approach <https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/source/features/task_workflows.html>`_
for their applications.

While we maintain backward compatibility with Isaac Sim 2023.1.1, we highly recommend using Isaac Lab with
Isaac Sim 4.0.0 version for the latest features and improvements.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/isaac-sim/IsaacLab/compare/v0.3.1...v1.0.0

New Features
------------

* Integrated CI/CD pipeline, which is triggered on pull requests and publishes the results publicly
* Extended support for Windows OS platforms
* Added `tiled rendered <https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/source/features/tiled_rendering.html>`_ based Camera sensor implementation. This provides optimized RGB-D rendering throughputs of up to 10k frames per second.
* Added support for multi-GPU and multi-node training for the RL-Games library
* Integrated APIs for environment designing (direct workflow) without relying on managers
* Added implementation of delayed PD actuator model
* `Added various new learning environments <https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/main/source/features/environments.html>`_:
  * Cartpole balancing using images
  * Shadow hand cube reorientation
  * Boston Dynamics Spot locomotion
  * Unitree H1 and G1 locomotion
  * ANYmal-C navigation
  * Quadcopter target reaching

Improvements
------------

* Reduced start-up time for scripts (inherited from Isaac Sim 4.0 improvements)
* Added lazy buffer implementation for rigid object and articulation data. Instead of updating all the quantities at every step call, the lazy buffers are updated only when the user queries them
* Added SKRL support to more environments
