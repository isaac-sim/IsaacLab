Release Notes
=============

v2.0.0
======

Overview
--------

Isaac Lab 2.0 brings some exciting new features, including a new addition to the Imitation Learning
workflow with the **Isaac Lab Mimic** extension.
Isaac Lab Mimic provides the ability to automatically generate additional trajectories based on
just a few human collected demonstrations, allowing for larger training datasets with less human effort.
This work is based on the `MimicGenv <https://mimicgen.github.io/>`_ work for Scalable Robot Learning using Human Demonstrations.

Additionally, we introduced a new set of AMP tasks based on `Adversarial Motion Priors <https://xbpeng.github.io/projects/AMP/index.html>`_,
training humanoid robots to walk, run, and dance ðŸ‘¯

Along with Isaac Lab 2.0, Isaac Sim 4.5 brings several new and breaking changes, including a full refactor of the Isaac Sim extensions,
an improved URDF importer, an update to the PyTorch dependency to version 2.5.1,
and many fixes for tiled rendering that now supports multiple tiled
cameras at different resolutions.

To follow the refactoring in Isaac Sim, we made similar refactoring and restructuring changes to Isaac Lab.
These breaking changes will no longer be compatible with previous Isaac Sim versions. Please make sure to update to Isaac Sim 4.5
when using the Isaac Lab 2.0 release.

Please refer to `Migration Guide <migration.html>`_ for a detailed list of breaking changes and guides for updating your codebase.

Migration Guide
---------------

Renaming of Isaac Sim Extensions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Previously, Isaac Sim extensions have been following the convention of ``omni.isaac.*``,
such as ``omni.isaac.core``. In Isaac Sim 4.5, Isaac Sim extensions have been renamed
to use the prefix ``isaacsim``, replacing ``omni.isaac``. In addition, many extensions
have been renamed and split into multiple extensions to prepare for a more modular
framework that can be customized by users through the use of app templates.

Notably, the following commonly used Isaac Sim extensions in Isaac Lab are renamed as follow:

* ``omni.isaac.cloner`` --> ``isaacsim.core.cloner``
* ``omni.isaac.core.prims`` --> ``isaacsim.core.prims``
* ``omni.isaac.core.simulation_context`` --> ``isaacsim.core.api.simulation_context``
* ``omni.isaac.core.utils`` --> ``isaacsim.core.utils``
* ``omni.isaac.core.world`` --> ``isaacsim.core.api.world``
* ``omni.isaac.kit.SimulationApp`` --> ``isaacsim.SimulationApp``
* ``omni.isaac.ui`` --> ``isaacsim.gui.components``


Renaming of the URDF and MJCF Importers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting from Isaac Sim 4.5, the URDF and MJCF importers have been renamed to be more consistent
with the other extensions in Isaac Sim. The importers are available on isaac-sim GitHub
as open source projects.

Due to the extension name change, the Python module names have also been changed:

* URDF Importer: :mod:`isaacsim.asset.importer.urdf` (previously :mod:`omni.importer.urdf`)
* MJCF Importer: :mod:`isaacsim.asset.importer.mjcf` (previously :mod:`omni.importer.mjcf`)

From the Isaac Sim UI, both URDF and MJCF importers can now be accessed directly from the File > Import
menu when selecting a corresponding .urdf or .xml file in the file browser.


Changes in URDF Importer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Isaac Sim 4.5 brings some updates to the URDF Importer, with a fresh UI to allow for better configurations
when importing robots from URDF. As a result, the Isaac Lab URDF Converter has also been updated to
reflect these changes. The :class:`UrdfConverterCfg` includes some new settings, such as :class:`PDGainsCfg`
and :class:`NaturalFrequencyGainsCfg` classes for configuring the gains of the drives.

One breaking change to note is that the :attr:`UrdfConverterCfg.JointDriveCfg.gains` attribute must
be of class type :class:`PDGainsCfg` or :class:`NaturalFrequencyGainsCfg`.

The stiffness of the :class:`PDGainsCfg` must be specified, as such:

.. code::python

    joint_drive=sim_utils.UrdfConverterCfg.JointDriveCfg(
        gains=sim_utils.UrdfConverterCfg.JointDriveCfg.PDGainsCfg(stiffness=None, damping=None)
    )

The :attr:`natural_frequency` must be specified for :class:`NaturalFrequencyGainsCfg`.


Renaming of omni.isaac.core Classes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Isaac Sim 4.5 introduced some naming changes to the core prim classes that are commonly
used in Isaac Lab. These affect the single and ``View`` variations of the prim classes, including
Articulation, RigidPrim, XFormPrim, and others. Single-object classes are now prefixed with
``Single``, such as ``SingleArticulation``, while tensorized View classes now have the ``View``
suffix removed.

The exact renamings of the classes are as follow:

* ``Articulation`` --> ``SingleArticulation``
* ``ArticulationView`` --> ``Articulation``
* ``ClothPrim`` --> ``SingleClothPrim``
* ``ClothPrimView`` --> ``ClothPrim``
* ``DeformablePrim`` --> ``SingleDeformablePrim``
* ``DeformablePrimView`` --> ``DeformablePrim``
* ``GeometryPrim`` --> ``SingleGeometryPrim``
* ``GeometryPrimView`` --> ``GeometryPrim``
* ``ParticleSystem`` --> ``SingleParticleSystem``
* ``ParticleSystemView`` --> ``ParticleSystem``
* ``RigidPrim`` --> ``SingleRigidPrim``
* ``RigidPrimView`` --> ``RigidPrim``
* ``XFormPrim`` --> ``SingleXFormPrim``
* ``XFormPrimView`` --> ``XFormPrim``


Renaming of Isaac Lab Extensions and Folders
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Corresponding to Isaac Sim 4.5 changes, we have also made some updates to the Isaac Lab directories and extensions.
All extensions that were previously under ``source/extensions`` are now under the ``source/`` directory directly.
The ``source/apps`` and ``source/standalone`` folders have been moved to the root directory and are now called
``apps/`` and ``scripts/``.

Isaac Lab extensions have been renamed to:

* ``omni.isaac.lab`` --> ``isaaclab``
* ``omni.isaac.lab_assets`` --> ``isaaclab_assets``
* ``omni.isaac.lab_tasks`` --> ``isaaclab_tasks``

In addition, we have split up the previous ``source/standalone/workflows`` directory into ``scripts/imitation_learning``
and ``scripts/reinforcement_learning`` directories. The RSL RL, Stable-Baselines, RL_Games, SKRL, and Ray directories
are under ``scripts/reinforcement_learning``, while Robomimic and the new Isaac Lab Mimic directories are under
``scripts/imitation_learning``.

To assist with the renaming of Isaac Lab extensions in your project, we have provided a `simple script`_ that will traverse
through the ``source`` and ``docs`` directories in your local Isaac Lab project and replace any instance of the renamed
directories and imports. **Please use the script at your own risk as it will overwrite source files directly.**


Restructuring of Isaac Lab Extensions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With the introduction of ``isaaclab_mimic``, designed for supporting data generation workflows for imitation learning,
we have also split out the previous ``wrappers`` folder under ``isaaclab_tasks`` to its own module, named ``isaaclab_rl``.
This new extension will contain reinforcement learning specific wrappers for the various RL libraries supported by Isaac Lab.

The new ``isaaclab_mimic`` extension will also replace the previous imitation learning scripts under the ``robomimic`` folder.
We have removed the old scripts for data collection and dataset preparation in favor of the new mimic workflow. For users
who prefer to use the previous scripts, they will be available in previous release branches.

Additionally, we have also restructured the ``isaaclab_assets`` extension to be split into ``robots`` and ``sensors``
subdirectories. This allows for clearer separation between the pre-defined configurations provided in the extension.
For any existing imports such as ``from omni.isaac.lab_assets.anymal import ANYMAL_C_CFG``, please replace it with
``from isaaclab.robots.anymal import ANYMAL_C_CFG``.

Bug Fixes
---------

* Fixes rendering frame delays. Rendered images now faithfully represent the latest state of the physics scene. We added the flag

* Drops support for ``TiledCamera`` for Isaac Sim 4.1

Migration Guide
---------------

Setting the simulation device into the simulation context
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Previously, changing the simulation device to CPU required users to set other simulation parameters (such as disabling GPU physics and GPU pipelines). This made setting up the device appear complex. We now simplify the checks for device directly inside the simulation context, so users only need to specify the device through the configuration object.

Before:

.. code:: python

    sim_utils.SimulationCfg(device="cpu", use_gpu_pipeline=False, dt=0.01, physx=sim_utils.PhysxCfg(use_gpu=False))

Now:

.. code:: python

    sim_utils.SimulationCfg(device="cpu", dt=0.01, physx=sim_utils.PhysxCfg())

Setting the simulation device from CLI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Previously, users could specify the device through the command line argument ``--device_id``. However, this made it ambiguous when users wanted to set the device to CPU. Thus, instead of the device ID, users need to specify the device explicitly through the argument ``--device``. The valid options for the device name are:

* "cpu": runs simulation on CPU
* "cuda": runs simulation on GPU with device ID at default index
* "cuda:N": runs simulation on GPU with device ID at ``N``. For instance, "cuda:0" will use device at index "0".

Due to the above change, the command line interaction with some of the scripts has changed.

Before:

.. code:: bash

    ./isaaclab.sh -p source/standalone/workflows/sb3/train.py --task Isaac-Cartpole-v0 --headless --cpu

Now:

.. code:: bash

    ./isaaclab.sh -p source/standalone/workflows/sb3/train.py --task Isaac-Cartpole-v0 --headless --device cpu

Renaming of teleoperation device CLI in standalone scripts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since ``--device`` is now an argument provided by the AppLauncher, it conflicted with the command-line argument used for specifying the teleoperation-device in some of the standalone scripts. Thus, to fix this conflict, the teleoperation-device now needs to be specified through ``--teleop_device`` argument.

Before:

.. code:: bash

    ./isaaclab.sh -p source/standalone/environments/teleoperation/teleop_se3_agent.py --task Isaac-Lift-Cube-Franka-IK-Rel-v0 --num_envs 1 --device keyboard

Now:

.. code:: bash

    ./isaaclab.sh -p source/standalone/environments/teleoperation/teleop_se3_agent.py --task Isaac-Lift-Cube-Franka-IK-Rel-v0 --num_envs 1 --teleop_device keyboard


Using Python-version of container utility script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The prior `container.sh <https://github.com/isaac-sim/IsaacLab/blob/v1.1.0/docker/container.sh>`_ became quite complex as it had many different use cases in one script. For instance, building a docker image for "base" or "ros2", as well as cluster deployment. As more users wanted to have the flexibility to overlay their own docker settings, maintaining this bash script became cumbersome. Hence, we migrated its features into a Python script in this release. Additionally, we split the cluster-related utilities into their own script inside the ``docker/cluster`` directory.

We still maintain backward compatibility for ``container.sh``. Internally, it calls the Python script ``container.py``. We request users to use the Python script directly.

Before:

.. code:: bash

    ./docker/container.sh start


Now:

.. code:: bash

    ./docker/container.py start


Using separate directories for logging videos in RL workflows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Previously, users could record videos during the RL training by specifying the ``--video`` flag to the ``train.py`` script. The videos would be saved inside the ``videos`` directory in the corresponding log directory of the run.

Since many users requested to also be able to record videos while inferencing the policy, recording videos have also been added to the ``play.py`` script. Since changing the prefix of the video file names is not possible, the videos from the train and play scripts are saved inside the ``videos/train`` and ``videos/play`` directories, respectively.

Drops support for the tiled camera with Isaac Sim 4.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Various fixes have been made to the tiled camera rendering pipeline in Isaac Sim 4.2. This made supporting the tiled camera with Isaac Sim 4.1 difficult. Hence, for the best experience, we advice switching to Isaac Sim 4.2 with this release of Isaac Lab.

Breaking Changes
----------------

* Drops official support for Isaac Sim 2023.1.1
* Removes the use of body view inside the asset classes by @Mayankm96 in https://github.com/isaac-sim/IsaacLab/pull/643
* Renames ``SimulationCfg.substeps`` to ``SimulationCfg.render_interval`` by @Dhoeller19 in https://github.com/isaac-sim/IsaacLab/pull/515

Migration Guide
---------------

Renaming of ``SimulationCfg.substeps``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Previously, the users set both ``omni.isaac.lab.sim.SimulationCfg.dt`` and ``omni.isaac.lab.sim.SimulationCfg.substeps``, which marked the physics insulation time-step and sub-steps, respectively. It was unclear whether sub-steps meant the number of integration steps inside the physics time-step ``dt`` or the number of physics steps inside a rendering step.

Since in the code base, the attribute was used as the latter, it has been renamed to ``render_interval`` for clarity.

Removal of Deprecated Attributes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As notified in previous releases, we removed the classes and attributes marked as deprecated. These are as follows:

* The ``mdp.add_body_mass`` method in the events. Please use the ``mdp.randomize_rigid_body_mass`` instead.
* The classes ``managers.RandomizationManager`` and ``managers.RandomizationTermCfg``. Please use the ``managers.EventManager`` and ``managers.EventTermCfg`` classes instead.
* The following properties in ``omni.isaac.lab.sensors.FrameTransformerData``:
   * ``target_rot_source`` --> ``target_quat_w``
   * ``target_rot_w`` --> ``target_quat_source``
   * ``source_rot_w`` --> ``source_quat_w``
* The attribute ``body_physx_view`` from the ``omni.isaac.lab.assets.Articulation`` and ``omni.isaac.lab.assets.RigidObject`` classes. These caused confusion when used with the articulation view since the body names did not follow the same ordering.

v1.0.0
======

Overview
--------

Welcome to the first official release of Isaac Lab!

Building upon the foundation of the `Orbit <https://isaac-orbit.github.io/>`_ framework, we have integrated the RL environment designing workflow from `OmniIsaacGymEnvs <https://github.com/NVIDIA-Omniverse/OmniIsaacGymEnvs>`_. This allows users to choose a suitable `task-design approach <https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/source/features/task_workflows.html>`_ for their applications.

While we maintain backward compatibility with Isaac Sim 2023.1.1, we highly recommend using Isaac Lab with Isaac Sim 4.0.0 version for the latest features and improvements.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/isaac-sim/IsaacLab/compare/v0.3.1...v1.0.0

New Features
------------

* Integrated CI/CD pipeline, which is triggered on pull requests and publishes the results publicly
* Extended support for Windows OS platforms
* Added `tiled rendered <https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/source/features/tiled_rendering.html>`_ based Camera sensor implementation. This provides optimized RGB-D rendering throughputs of up to 10k frames per second.
* Added support for multi-GPU and multi-node training for the RL-Games library
* Integrated APIs for environment designing (direct workflow) without relying on managers
* Added implementation of delayed PD actuator model
* `Added various new learning environments <https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/main/source/features/environments.html>`_:
  * Cartpole balancing using images
  * Shadow hand cube reorientation
  * Boston Dynamics Spot locomotion
  * Unitree H1 and G1 locomotion
  * ANYmal-C navigation
  * Quadcopter target reaching

Improvements
------------

* Reduced start-up time for scripts (inherited from Isaac Sim 4.0 improvements)
* Added lazy buffer implementation for rigid object and articulation data. Instead of updating all the quantities at every step call, the lazy buffers are updated only when the user queries them
* Added SKRL support to more environments

Breaking Changes
----------------

For users coming from Orbit, this release brings certain breaking changes. Please check the migration guide for more information.
