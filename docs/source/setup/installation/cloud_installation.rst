Cloud Deployment
================

Isaac Lab can be run in various cloud infrastructures with the use of
`Isaac Automator <https://github.com/isaac-sim/IsaacAutomator>`__.

Isaac Automator allows for quick deployment of Isaac Sim and Isaac Lab onto
the public clouds (AWS, GCP, Azure, and Alibaba Cloud are currently supported).
The result is a fully configured remote desktop cloud workstation, which can
be used for development and testing of Isaac Lab within minutes and on a budget.
Isaac Automator supports variety of GPU instances and stop-start functionality
to save on cloud costs and a variety of tools to aid the workflow
(such as uploading and downloading data, autorun, deployment management, etc).


System Requirements
-------------------

Isaac Automator requires having ``docker`` pre-installed on the system.

* To install Docker, please follow the instructions for your operating system on the
  `Docker website`_. A minimum version of 26.0.0 for Docker Engine and 2.25.0 for Docker
  compose are required to work with Isaac Automator.
* Follow the post-installation steps for Docker on the `post-installation steps`_ page.
  These steps allow you to run Docker without using ``sudo``.


Installing Isaac Automator
--------------------------

For the most update-to-date and complete installation instructions, please refer to
`Isaac Automator <https://github.com/isaac-sim/IsaacAutomator?tab=readme-ov-file#installation>`__.

To use Isaac Automator, first clone the repo:

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: HTTPS

      .. code-block:: bash

         git clone https://github.com/isaac-sim/IsaacAutomator.git

   .. tab-item:: SSH

      .. code-block:: bash

         git clone git@github.com:isaac-sim/IsaacAutomator.git


Isaac Automator requires obtaining a NGC API key.

* Get access to the `Isaac Sim container`_ by joining the NVIDIA Developer Program credentials.
* Generate your `NGC API key`_ to access locked container images from NVIDIA GPU Cloud (NGC).

  * This step requires you to create an NGC account if you do not already have one.
  * Once you have your generated API key, you need to log in to NGC
    from the terminal.

    .. code:: bash

         docker login nvcr.io

  * For the username, enter ``$oauthtoken`` exactly as shown. It is a special username that is used to
    authenticate with NGC.

    .. code:: text

        Username: $oauthtoken
        Password: <Your NGC API Key>


Building the container
----------------------

To run Isaac Automator, first build the Isaac Automator container:

.. tab-set::
   :sync-group: os

   .. tab-item:: :icon:`fa-brands fa-linux` Linux
      :sync: linux

      .. code-block:: bash

         ./build

   .. tab-item:: :icon:`fa-brands fa-windows` Windows
      :sync: windows

      .. code-block:: batch

         docker build --platform linux/x86_64 -t isa .


This will build the Isaac Automator container and tag it as ``isa``.


Running the Automator Commands
------------------------------

First, enter the Automator container:

.. tab-set::
   :sync-group: os

   .. tab-item:: :icon:`fa-brands fa-linux` Linux
      :sync: linux

      .. code-block:: bash

         ./run

   .. tab-item:: :icon:`fa-brands fa-windows` Windows
      :sync: windows

      .. code-block:: batch

         docker run --platform linux/x86_64 -it --rm -v .:/app isa bash

Next, run the deployment script for your preferred cloud:

.. note::

   The ``--isaaclab`` flag is used to specify the version of Isaac Lab to deploy.
   The ``v2.2.1`` tag is the latest release of Isaac Lab.

.. tab-set::
   :sync-group: cloud

   .. tab-item:: AWS
      :sync: aws

      .. code-block:: bash

         ./deploy-aws --isaaclab v2.2.1

   .. tab-item:: Azure
      :sync: azure

      .. code-block:: bash

         ./deploy-azure --isaaclab v2.2.1

   .. tab-item:: GCP
      :sync: gcp

      .. code-block:: bash

         ./deploy-gcp --isaaclab v2.2.1

   .. tab-item:: Alibaba Cloud
      :sync: alicloud

      .. code-block:: bash

         ./deploy-alicloud --isaaclab v2.2.1

Follow the prompts for entering information regarding the environment setup and credentials.
Once successful, instructions for connecting to the cloud instance will be available
in the terminal. The deployed Isaac Sim instances can be accessed via:

- SSH
- noVCN (browser-based VNC client)
- NoMachine (remote desktop client)

Look for the connection instructions at the end of the deployment command output.
Additionally, this info is saved in ``state/<deployment-name>/info.txt`` file.

For details on the credentials and setup required for each cloud, please visit the
`Isaac Automator <https://github.com/isaac-sim/IsaacAutomator?tab=readme-ov-file#deploying-isaac-sim>`__
page for more instructions.


Running Isaac Lab on the Cloud
------------------------------

Once connected to the cloud instance, the desktop will have an icon showing ``isaaclab.sh``.
Launch the ``isaaclab.sh`` executable, which will open a new Terminal. Within the terminal,
Isaac Lab commands can be executed in the same way as running locally.

For example:

.. tab-set::
   :sync-group: os

   .. tab-item:: :icon:`fa-brands fa-linux` Linux
      :sync: linux

      .. code-block:: bash

         ./isaaclab.sh -p scripts/reinforcement_learning/rl_games/train.py --task=Isaac-Cartpole-v0

   .. tab-item:: :icon:`fa-brands fa-windows` Windows
      :sync: windows

      .. code-block:: batch

         isaaclab.bat -p scripts/reinforcement_learning/rl_games/train.py --task=Isaac-Cartpole-v0


Destroying a Deployment
-----------------------

To save costs, deployments can be destroyed when not being used.
This can be done from within the Automator container.

Enter the Automator container with the command described in the previous section:

.. tab-set::
   :sync-group: os

   .. tab-item:: :icon:`fa-brands fa-linux` Linux
      :sync: linux

      .. code-block:: bash

         ./run

   .. tab-item:: :icon:`fa-brands fa-windows` Windows
      :sync: windows

      .. code-block:: batch

         docker run --platform linux/x86_64 -it --rm -v .:/app isa bash


To destroy a deployment, run the following command from within the container:

.. code:: bash

   ./destroy <deployment-name>
