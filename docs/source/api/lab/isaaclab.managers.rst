Scene Entity
------------

.. autoclass:: SceneEntityCfg
    :members:
    :exclude-members: __init__

Resolved selections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``SceneEntityCfg.resolve(scene)`` creates an :class:`~isaaclab.utils.IndexSequence`
for each non-slice joint, body, fixed-tendon, and object-collection selection. The
sequence owns host integers and a cached ``torch.long`` tensor on the scene device.
Managers resolve their copies of term configurations before calling the terms.

.. code-block:: python

    cfg = SceneEntityCfg("robot", body_names=["left_foot", "right_foot"])
    cfg.resolve(env.scene)
    positions = env.scene["robot"].data.body_pos_w.torch[:, cfg.body_ids]
    first_body = cfg.body_ids[0]  # Python int; no device readback
    body_names = [env.scene["robot"].body_names[i] for i in cfg.body_ids]

Torch indexing and Torch functions unwrap the sequence through ``__torch_function__``.
Python iteration, scalar indexing, comparison with lists, and ``len`` use host data.
Slices remain slices, preserving ordinary tensor view semantics.

Migration: resolved selectors are read-only sequences rather than mutable lists.
Use ``list(cfg.body_ids)`` when an editable host copy is needed, and replace the
selection and call ``resolve`` again after configuration changes. Replace checks
for ``list`` with checks for ``collections.abc.Sequence`` or explicit slice checks.

Tensor constructors do not dispatch through ``__torch_function__``. Use
``cfg.body_ids.torch`` for a non-slice selector, or
``isaaclab.utils.convert_to_torch(cfg.body_ids)`` when a tensor is required.
Do not mutate the cached tensor. Slicing the sequence itself returns a host list;
use ``cfg.body_ids.torch[1:]`` to obtain a device view.

Configuration serialization writes ordinary host lists and slices. Read-only
selections can share their storage across configuration copies; re-resolution on
another device creates new storage. Device caches have no process-wide owner.
Native APIs and compiled consumers may need the explicit ``.torch`` view.

Observation Manager
-------------------

Observation delay
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Configure observation delay directly on the term:

.. code-block:: python

    from isaaclab.envs import mdp
    from isaaclab.managers import ObservationTermCfg

    joint_pos = ObservationTermCfg(func=mdp.joint_pos_rel, delay_min_lag=1, delay_max_lag=3)

Each environment samples its lag uniformly from the inclusive bounds at initialization and reset.
By default, ``delay_hold_prob=1.0`` keeps that lag for the episode, matching the reset-based lag policy of
:class:`~isaaclab.actuators.DelayedPDActuator`. Equal bounds give a constant delay; both zero disable delay.
Both use :class:`~isaaclab.utils.buffers.DelayBuffer`; observation lag counts recorded observation
samples, while actuator lag counts physics steps.

Set ``delay_hold_prob`` below 1.0 to vary latency within an episode:

.. code-block:: python

    joint_pos = ObservationTermCfg(func=mdp.joint_pos_rel, delay_min_lag=1, delay_max_lag=3, delay_hold_prob=0.8)

On each recorded sample, each environment retains its lag with probability 0.8 and otherwise draws a new
one. Zero redraws on every sample. Holding the lag keeps the latency constant while frames continue to
advance; it does not freeze the returned frame. Reset always redraws the selected environments' lags.

The processing order is observation function, modifiers, noise, clipping, scaling, delay, then history.
The ``delay_min_lag`` and ``delay_max_lag`` field names and delay placement follow
`mjlab's observation configuration <https://mujocolab.github.io/mjlab/main/source/observations.html>`_.
``delay_hold_prob`` follows mjlab's lag-retention semantics, with a default of 1.0 to preserve Isaac Lab's
reset-based delay policy.

``compute(update_history=True)`` records a sample in both delay and observation history buffers.
``compute()`` and ``compute_group()`` read without advancing either buffer or resampling lag.
For a delay buffer with no recorded sample after initialization or reset, the current input is returned
without recording it. Once recording starts, delays exceeding the available history return the oldest
sample. Partial resets invalidate only the selected environments' histories.

Observation outputs are independent snapshots: later simulation steps, modifier updates, and resets
do not overwrite previously returned tensors. The manager automatically copies borrowed storage before
mutation or retention. Term and custom callback outputs are treated conservatively, without decorators
or task-level copy settings. Clipping and scaling create independent storage when needed, which later
processing can reuse. A term that already returns an independent tensor may still be copied when the
pipeline cannot establish ownership itself.

Observation callables may declare an optional keyword-only ``out`` parameter to write directly
into a manager-provided destination, for example ``def observation(env, ..., *, out=None)``.
When ``out`` is None, the callable returns an observation normally. When supplied, it must fill and
return that exact tensor without retaining it, resizing it, or replacing its storage.

The manager checks the signature once during initialization. Only an explicitly declared keyword-only
``out=None`` enables destination writes; accepting arbitrary ``**kwargs`` does not. The manager probes
the ordinary call to infer shape, dtype and device, which must remain constant, then allocates a fresh
contiguous destination for each computation. ``out`` is reserved and must not appear in term ``params``.
Custom modifiers, noise and history retain their usual snapshot protections. Built-in
:class:`~isaaclab.envs.mdp.observations.image_rgb` terms use this interface automatically to avoid a
second full-image copy for normalized uint8 images. Existing observation configurations require no changes.
