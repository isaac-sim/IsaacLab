Sim2Real Deployment of Policies Trained in Isaac Lab
====================================================

Welcome to the Policy Deployment Guide! This section provides examples of training policies in Isaac Lab and deploying them to both simulation and real robots.

Below, youâ€™ll find detailed examples of various policies for training and deploying them, along with essential configuration details.

- **Kinova Gen3 RL & Sim2Real Toolkit**
    Modular extension for Isaac Lab that trains RL reach-task
    policies on Kinova Gen3 and runs them in simulation or on
    the real arm via a minimal ROS 2 sim-to-real interface -

- **Wheeled Lab for Mobile Robots**
    Demonstrates three sim-to-real RL policies (drifting,
    elevation traversal, and visual navigation) for small
    RC cars, all trained in Isaac Lab and tested on
    low-cost hardware -
