Sim2Real Deployment of Policies Trained in Isaac Lab
====================================================

Welcome to the Policy Deployment Guide! This section provides examples of training policies in Isaac Lab and deploying them to both simulation and real robots.

Below, you’ll find detailed examples of various policies for training and deploying them, along with essential configuration details.

- **Closing the Sim-to-Real Gap: Training Spot Quadruped Locomotion with NVIDIA Isaac Lab**  
    Shows how to train a robust locomotion policy for the 
    Boston Dynamics Spot quadruped in Isaac Lab and deploy 
    it zero-shot on the real robot using NVIDIA Jetson Orin -

- **Kinova Gen3 RL & Sim2Real Toolkit**
    Modular extension for Isaac Lab that trains RL reach-task 
    policies on Kinova Gen3 and runs them in simulation or on 
    the real arm via a minimal ROS 2 sim-to-real interface - 
    `GitHub repository <https://github.com/louislelay/kinova_isaaclab_sim2real>`_  

- **WheeledLab for Mobile Robots**  
    Demonstrates three sim-to-real RL policies—drifting, 
    elevation traversal, and visual navigation—for small 
    RC cars, all trained in Isaac Lab and tested on 
    low-cost hardware -
