This software license agreement ("Agreement") is a legal agreement between you, whether an individual or entity, ("you") and NVIDIA Corporation ("NVIDIA") and governs the use of the NVIDIA cuRobo and related software and materials that NVIDIA delivers to you under this Agreement ("Software").

By using the Software, you are affirming that you have read and agree to this Agreement.

If you don't accept all the terms and conditions below, do not use the Software.

1. License Grant. The Software made available by NVIDIA to you is licensed, not sold.

2. License Restrictions. Your license to use the Software is restricted as stated in this Section 2 ("License Restrictions"). You will cooperate with NVIDIA and, upon NVIDIA's written request, you will confirm in writing and provide reasonably requested information to verify your compliance with the terms of this Agreement. You may not:

2.1 Use the Software for any purpose other than the Purpose, and for clarity use of NVIDIA cuRobo apart from use with Isaac Lab is outside of the Purpose;

2.3 Reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Software components provided in binary form, nor attempt in any other manner to obtain source code of such Software;

2.5 Change or remove copyright or other proprietary notices in the Software;

2.6 Bypass, disable, or circumvent any technical limitation, encryption, security, digital rights management or authentication mechanism in the Software;

2.8 Use the Software in violation of any applicable law or regulation in relevant jurisdictions.

3. Authorized Users. You may allow employees and contractors of your entity or of your subsidiary(ies), and for educational institutions also enrolled students, to internally access and use the Software as authorized by this Agreement from your secure network to perform the work authorized by this Agreement on your behalf. You are responsible for the compliance with the terms of this Agreement by your authorized users. Any act or omission that if committed by you would constitute a breach of this Agreement will be deemed to constitute a breach of this Agreement if committed by your authorized users.

4. Pre-Release. Software versions identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access or otherwise as pre-release ("Pre-Release") may not be fully functional, may contain errors or design flaws, and may have reduced or different security, privacy, availability and reliability standards relative to NVIDIA commercial offerings. You use Pre-Release Software at your own risk. NVIDIA did not design or test the Software for use in production or business-critical systems. NVIDIA may choose not to make available a commercial version of Pre-Release Software. NVIDIA may also choose to abandon development and terminate the availability of Pre-Release Software at any time without liability.

5. Updates. NVIDIA may at any time and at its option, change, discontinue, or deprecate any part, or all, of the Software, or change or remove features or functionality, or make available patches, workarounds or other updates to the Software. Unless the updates are provided with their separate governing terms, they are deemed part of the Software licensed to you under this Agreement, and your continued use of the Software is deemed acceptance of such changes.

6. Components Under Other Licenses. The Software may include or be distributed with components provided with separate legal notices or terms that accompany the components, such as open source software licenses and other license terms ("Other Licenses"). The components are subject to the applicable Other Licenses, including any proprietary notices, disclaimers, requirements and extended use rights; except that this Agreement will prevail regarding the use of third-party open source software, unless a third-party open source software license requires its license terms to prevail. Open source software license means any software, data or documentation subject to any license identified as an open source license by the Open Source Initiative (http://opensource.org), Free Software Foundation (http://www.fsf.org) or other similar open source organization or listed by the Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX) Workgroup under the Linux Foundation (http://www.spdx.org).

8. Feedback. You may, but you are not obligated to, provide suggestions, requests, fixes, modifications, enhancements, or other feedback regarding the Software (collectively, "Feedback"). Feedback, even if designated as confidential by you, will not create any confidentiality obligation for NVIDIA or its affiliates. If you provide Feedback, you grant NVIDIA, its affiliates and its designees a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, sublicensable, worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid-up and transferable license, under your intellectual property rights, to publicly perform, publicly display, reproduce, use, make, have made, sell, offer for sale, distribute (through multiple tiers of distribution), import, create derivative works of and otherwise commercialize and exploit the Feedback at NVIDIA's discretion.
