NLopt combines several free/open-source nonlinear optimization
libraries by various authors.  See the COPYING, COPYRIGHT, and README
files in the subdirectories for the original copyright and licensing
information of these packages.

The compiled NLopt library, i.e. the combined work of all of the
included optimization routines, is licensed under the conjunction of
all of these licensing terms. By default, the most restrictive terms
are for the code in the "luksan" directory, which is licensed under
the GNU Lesser General Public License (GNU LGPL), version 2.1 or
later (see luksan/COPYRIGHT). That means that, by default, the compiled
NLopt library is governed by the terms of the LGPL.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

However, NLopt also offers the option to be built without the code in
the "luksan" directory. In this case, NLopt, including any modifications
to the abovementioned packages, are licensed under the standard "MIT License:"
